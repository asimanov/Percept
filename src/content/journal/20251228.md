### 20251224

#### Meditation 

- Afternoon.
- 30 Minutes.
- Dick Sutphen - Chakra Meditation. 
- Usual mid-week chakra balancing. 
- After this morning's 8-mile run in the rain I've been somewhat drained but also energized. It's hard to explain. Running always energizes me, but sometimes I have to be extra alert like today. 
- Anyways, it was a nice Christmas Eve run full of grit and determination.
- Good choice in general, even if Sutphen's work tends to drop me in and out of existence, it seems. 
- Nice to put something on and let my subprocesses run as I allow myself to click in and out as needed. 
- Attempted a quick altered state but never "launched." Needed the rest.

### 20251225

#### Meditation 

- Afternoon, 30 minutes, Expand App Focus 21 timer.
- Christmas excitement (children) left me tired. Made it to F15, stopped there.
- Kept getting jolts on the way up through focus levels. Took it as a sign F21 wasn't happening today.
- Manifestation session in F15 with some foot and hand twitches.
- Stopped in F12 on the way out, did usual contact proclamation.
- NVC: someone drinking a 1-liter bottle of clear liquid. Guessing live. Hydration message from guides. I listened.

#### Micro Lucid Dreams & Liminal

- Intent: altered state experience (lucid dream/projection) + "connect with my guides."
- Got 3 rapid-fire lucid dreams afterward. None made sense, none were staging environments.
- Another Liminal appeared in the liminal space between altered state and waking.
- Increasingly confident these Liminals are communications from guides. What I'm viewing is a "3D shadow" of higher dimensional object/entity.
- Theory: these visions occur from DMT flush as one state ends and waking begins. Seen Liminals between all state transitions.
- Central realization: the objects are *my* perception of transmitted data. Communication is data, data is interpreted. Sender uses their symbolic language, recipient only has their own constructs/archetypes to interpret with. Angels looked the way they did because of symbolic language at that time. Modern culture has radically different symbolic language based on morals and technology. *That* shapes perception of "foreign" data packets.
- Questions: Who/what is sending? Actual NHI? Human construct/archetype? Maybe collective name for contact entity that exists in non-local?
- Guides might not be personal but generic to everyone. Perception changes their shape/presentation, gestalt intact.
- Maybe these non-local entities are always broadcasting, we just pick up the signal. Not special for being "chosen." It's **your** choice to turn and look.
- Today's Liminal: appeared on head bust, geometric at first (round circles for eyes/mouth), then rapidly changing faces. All speaking in unison, single unified message. Couldn't hear but felt it was same message.
- Recurring type: shifting/changing visual planes, glitchy behavior.
- Contact protocol in F12 + intent to connect + early Liminal showing "3" written three times → all pointing at angels, biblical archetypes. Cherubim?
- Went to biblical angels/Western esotericism because that's my cultural background. Makes sense I'd pull from deep archetypical imagery when confronted with foreign DATA.

### 20251226

#### Meditation 

- Afternoon.
- 35 Minutes.
- Expand App, timer section, Focus 15.
- I'm risking sounding like a broken record, but this document is created for documentation, so here it goes: very tired today.
- Difficulty keeping my focus, constantly blanking, risking falling asleep at every turn of this meditation.
- I chose F15 because of how I felt yesterday. Today felt similar but somehow I'm more tired. I guess it makes sense. 
- After this "struggle-bus" session I was ready to sleep. 
- I think my primary focus should be on rest and recovery for the next couple days. An intensive week is up ahead and I want to make the most of it. 

#### Lucid Dreams

- Same progression of micro lucid dreams as yesterday afternoon.
- A Liminal did appear after the first or the second lucid dream, but ultimately had a very difficult time perceiving it. 
- All of this was followed by a couple more failed attempts.

#### Guided Meditation 

- Afternoon.
- 35 Minutes.
- The Gateway Experience, Wave VI - Odyssey, Movement to Locale 2 - Intro Focus 21.
- I decided to repeat this one again today. I have done this tape several times this year with every step I make toward feeling like "I'm ready." In my opinion, I moved on to Focus 21 earlier than I should have. This isn't bad. It illuminated the reality that shadow work doesn't ever stop and that there's always more to do. 
- In the last few months I've noticed a marked progression in my response to F21 frequency. Slowly and over weeks, that space has been more and more accessible. 
- Sometimes it's also nice to just follow a guided meditation without any plan. 
- The "bright light of Focus 21" is more evident now than ever. I'm still learning the frequency and getting comfortable with it, but today once I moved through and entered F21, I did notice something new.
- Upon entering F21 I observed cascading and shimmering light displayed in my field of view for a couple minutes. It was very nice and soothing. The "light curtain" didn't have a single color but rather iridescent in appearance. 
- Once I was moved out of F21 and back to F12, I gave my thanks and gratitude, extended an invitation for contact from individuals aligned with unconditional love, and moved out of the meditation entirely. 

#### Lucid Dreams

- Per usual, I shut everything off and rolled over for an hour or so to catch an altered state or two.
- This week has not been as strong and busy as last week when it comes to lucid dreams and projections.
- Much like the week began, I had the same brief and short-lived lucid dreams. In fact, I'd categorize most of them as dreams where I become lucid much later than a traditional lucid dream. 
- No projections today.
- The last dream where I became lucid was a little interesting. The setting was the agency's office for which I work. I was talking to colleagues at one part of the building while I got a Slack notification from another colleague wishing me a good evening as they were heading out. That was odd. This particular person never does this. I said goodbye to the folks I was having a conversation with and headed back to my desk as I read the message again. In that moment I became lucid and with that started to sprint down a hallway, jump in the air, and dive into the ground. As I hit the ground I entered a wormhole. I traveled down this one in mostly darkness for a long time, much longer than usual. Flashes of strobing white light passed me as I twisted and turned through the structure. For a minute I was wondering if this is actually leading to something, but nonetheless I came to a waking state, opening my eyes and seeing my office from the same direction where I left it. 
- No Liminals to record today.  

#### Bedtime 

- This was interesting and you might be seeing more entries with notes from late-night/bedtime activities as I've been experimenting around this time a bit more lately.
- Usually I'm so tired at the end of the day that I hit the pillow, do a quick check of my system, and it's lights out very quickly. 
- Lately I've been pausing a bit and throwing questions out into the void in a sort of semi-meditative state that I often find myself in before losing consciousness. 
- With my recent conclusions about the Liminals and subsequent quieting of their activity, I began to make a serious request to my higher self about connecting. 
- I made a heartfelt request to connect, higher self or guides (or both, because it's probably both). 
- When I do this type of one-way communication I visualize "releasing" the "data packet" and watch it ascend. 
- What's neat is that over the last 6 months or so I haven't had to visualize any of that. It happens and I see the "data" ascending upward. It's very quick, very fuzzy looking blob that moves from bottom-center to the top and out of my field of view.
- I call this "one-way" communication because there's never an immediate answer. 
- This time I got an immediate response that almost snapped me out of my trance. 
- The moment the "data packet" left my view there was a burst of concentrated, bright ball of light that seemed to come from the top-right of my field of view to the center, then spread very quickly and dissipated. All of this happens very quickly, nothing slow about it. 
- Neat!

### 20251228

#### Guided Meditation 

- Afternoon.
- 40 Minutes.
- Expand App, timer section, Focus 21.
- Prep went well, moving through focus levels was uneventful.
- After a moment of silence in F21 I did make a request to connect with guides and my higher self. After a bit more of the same I made my exit into Focus 15.
- While in F15 I did some manifestation work. This time I focused on specific situations, small movements so to speak, of the larger picture. Employing all of your senses on a general scenario isn't as efficient as focusing on specific aspects of it. That's my focus recently. 
- F12, usual business. 
- F10, set intent for altered state experience, physical affirmation, and exit. 

#### Lucid Dream 

- Much like the rest of the week, this lucid dream was another regular dream in which I became lucid. 
- The setting was an evening walk with Kim. 
- We were making our way out of the neighborhood behind our house and turned down a main street.
- Without much of a warning Kim darts across the main street. I become lucid here.
- She was on a mission. I run out into the street after her and realize what's going on. I decide it's best we fly where she wants to go and begin to take off while scanning the ground to pick her up. 
- Lucid dream breaks up at this point and my awareness goes down the familiar portal, exiting with warm white light flooding my field of view.

#### Liminal

- I did catch a somewhat recognizable Liminal this time.
- It wasn't very big, same location as always at the bottom right of my field of view.
- The overall shape was purely geometric this time, didn't materialize or "build" up to anything more than a few shapes. 
- The primary shapes were a circle/sphere and a square/box. Some shadow triangles could be seen vibrating and moving about behind and around the main structure.
- Overall, the entire Liminal was acting the same as before: jittering motion, shifting, redrawing, always in motion while appearing still. 
- After about half a minute or so the Liminal dematerialized into a single point and exited my reality.
