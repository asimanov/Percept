### Clearing the Field

**At the time I didn't realize that on this day, November 14th, I would be having a "Part II" of my "Clearing House" session (modified release-recharge) from a couple days back on November 11th. [Here is Part I](/journal/20251111) if you are interested or would like to refresh where I left off. The following are accounts and analysis of a meditation session and a projection which followed soon after.**

#### Part II: October 14, 2025

At 5 AM I committed to a 60 minute meditation session using the Expand App's timer function for Focus 21 (F21). The decision to go again at F21, but this time without guidance, came from wanting to have as much time as I need to figure out if it will be worth it or not in the future. I have long had issues with the F21 wall in the past but recently things seem to be unfolding.

I was a little tired in the morning but overall felt good. I got through prep with a couple minor hiccups but it was pretty much the same as usual. I slowly made my way through the focus levels until F21 and then rested in awareness for the rest of the meditation. I deliberately did not want to do anything because that has never worked here, and other than a couple brief interactions I normally do not experience much in F21.

In the past it took me a while to warm up to the levels preceding F21, but this one has been the longest for that process to even get going. Before long I began to have brief dream-like sequences. The trick to not falling asleep at this stage is to never interact with these scenes when they appear. Once you do, you get pulled right into them and dreamland arrives instantly. So it is best to sit in the moment and observe, not engage. And that is what I did.

There were a few distinct sequences, but the one that caught my attention the most was of me talking to my step-sister. We met briefly at some place and made plans to meet up again at another house and at a different time. After a little while of being here I decided I had enough and was pretty drained in general at this point. In reality my physical body was getting very hungry and had the "rumblies", which I found out after ending the session.

#### Projection

What unfolded after the Focus 21 meditation was relatively new to me. At approximately 6:15 AM I resituated myself and went through my intent sequence: **Now I am having a conscious out-of-body experience. Now I am out of body. Now I am out of body and stable in the state of exploration. Now, take me to the place where I learn about myself. Now, I am lucid and resting in awareness. I trust myself and the process. And so it is.**

At first I had a hard time falling asleep. I really wanted to, but the rogue and aggressive itches kept snapping me out of my groggy state. Eventually it happened, although not quite the way I expected. As I was finally falling asleep and about ready to blackout, moderate to heavy vibrations hit me from crown to root. I have spent so much time focusing on transitional or in-between states this year that awareness is automatic now. I mentally smiled and relaxed into the vibrations.

Falling through the bed and into a black void, I felt the vibrations intensify. After a minute everything slowly subsided into a gentle stop while my vision remained muted with a warm and light backdrop behind my eyes. Normally I would call this a failed attempt to go anywhere, but this time something was clearly off because it was still dark outside and dark in my office. There was no possible way for me to see a warm and soft white light with my eyes closed and covered with a blackout mask.

Monroe called this the perceptual break. Buhlman described it as the first stabilizing layer of the non-physical visual field.

Here is the next unusual part: I caught a wild liminal as this stage ended and the next began. Typically they occur in the chain of `altered state → liminal → waking state`. Except this time the chain branched into: 

`altered state → liminal → stable non-physical environment` 

Since liminals occur in the in-between, it makes sense that a transition was happening and a liminal appeared. I only expected to wake up because every chain I have had until now followed the first pattern. In other words, liminals appearing exactly at the phase boundary is consistent with my prior pattern.

And this is where things could have gotten disorienting, yet the illusion of what was happening was so deep and so rich that I found myself stepping into it as if I had been living it the whole day already. The light-colored backdrop fades, and I am driving in the hills with Kim and my dogs. No kids with us, but I was not concerned, so I knew they were safe.

We pulled into a driveway off a country road in the hills and parked under a minimal but clearly expensive carport in front of a large, modern, and formidable house. We got out and stretched our legs. There was construction going on next to the house. We walked over and looked at it like we already knew what was happening and expected to see this. The dogs ran around. I was starving. Remember, I had been hungry after the meditation session. I asked Kim if she was ready to get in the truck and go have lunch. The dogs were dusty now, great.

Across the street there were a few soldiers setting up or tearing down a three story structure. It did not look sturdy or safe. I waved at them. Another car approached from where we came. It drove up and parked behind my truck. At this point I realized the truck I was driving was red, and for some reason I cannot bring myself to edit this part out. So I guess it is important somehow and maybe will matter later.

A mixed bag of family members came out of the vehicle. My step-sister was one of them. She told me, "We made it just in time!" That is right! I was supposed to meet her here. I checked my watch, and it was exactly the time we planned. And remember, we made that plan during the dream-like sequence while I was meditating in F21 earlier that morning. Meeting her at the exact time we set earlier linked the two states into a single chain of intent to delivery.

Everyone went into the house, although I still did not really know whose house this was. It felt familiar. Everything inside, from decor to furniture to appliances, were all things I would choose. It was two stories, which is not my preference, but the stairs were very comfortable with three wide segments and not steep. There were children here now, but I still could not find my own. Again, I was not worried. While the children ran around, the adults gathered in the front living area. A trainer arrived and began setting up for a yoga class.

My step-sister and I talked about how we were doing and what we were going to do next. There was a sadness hanging there while we spoke. I reached out and we hugged. I said, "Remember, you are my family too." She replied, "I do, and you are too." This felt like integration of something. The sadness lifted and the class was about to start.

**An aside:** I have been thinking about this moment quite a bit since then, but decided that it will make sense to me when the time is right. This is classic integration territory. Whether it is personal memory, shadow, or an aspect of self, that line is a direct marker of internal reintegration. This lines up with exactly what happens after release-recharge or similar clearing work. When you move debris out of your field, the psyche often responds with a presentation of relational residue that is ready to resolve.

I got up and went upstairs because I was curious about this house I had never been in yet seemed to be designed with all the things I liked. Upstairs was spacious and full of light. One of the back bedrooms was clearly a boy's room, and an athletic boy's room at that. I walked in and looked out the window thinking there would be amazing views from here. And at first that is exactly what I saw: The Sierra Nevada, beautiful and clear. Looking down I noticed a street where a good friend of mine was scrambling out of their car and rushing toward the house. She was late for yoga class.

I ran downstairs to tease her about it, but while doing so I noticed footprints from me on the staircase. The staircase was not slick but finished with black tile. The details throughout the experience kept making me pause. I kept thinking how funny it was that I would pause at these details constantly because the quality of the experience was exactly as physical waking life.

Suddenly I was physically pulled out of the projection and found myself returning to present-time lucidity while laying on the daybed in my office. The projection reached its natural endpoint once the subconscious delivered the primary lesson.

#### Debrief

This was the first fully classic Focus 21 session for me. Following Monroe's terminology, F21 is often described as the bridge between physical and non-physical perception. It is a staging area where symbolic dream-like sequences begin to surface while awareness remains perfectly intact. Drifting sequences, staying passive, letting them unfold, all of these qualities and actions are exactly what the teaching material for this altered state describes.

The part that stayed with me, and one of the lessons from these events, is that there was definite continuity of intentional content from F21 into the projection. The sequence with my step-sister anchored the entire projection that followed.

The subconscious was tracking my intent and stitching a cohesive route. This was a legitimate and purposeful transfer and transmutation of data across altered states. Wild.
