### October 15, 2025

#### Self-hypnosis meditation

* 30 minutes.
* Today was filled with small annoyances: dropped my phone, my main machine glitched for no reason, and little issues kept slowing things down. No sense getting frustrated, so I laughed it off and kept moving.
* A good day for Chakra Balancing self-hypnosis.
* It still amazes me how quickly I enter deeper focus with self-hypnosis compared to binaural beats. That doesn’t make it better, it's only proof that training with binaurals makes this easier.
* I finished lighter and calmer than when I began.

### October 16, 2025

#### Freeflow meditation

* 30 minutes.
* Tom Campbell’s binaural beats, 256-128.
* Simple setup: move from F10 to F12 and pose the question, *“What is the frequency of my field?”*
* It was a dark session with little phosphene activity, but that helped my focus.
* After some time, a strong indigo orb appeared and hovered in the center of my field before fading.
* Physically, indigo sits around 670–750 THz with a wavelength near 445–425 nm, right on the threshold of ultraviolet light.
* Metaphysically, indigo ties to the third eye, intuition, perception, and non-physical vision.
* For now, I interpret my field’s frequency as resonating with inner vision and subtle perception. After the orb faded, closed-eye vision briefly activated (never perfectly clear, but distinct).

### October 17, 2025

#### Meditation

* William Buhlman “The Vortex” method.
* 30 minutes.
* Entered relaxed and clear on intention. Buhlman’s pacing always brings me into deep focus, similar to Sutphen’s.
* I noticed a few involuntary twitches on my left side that pulled me out briefly, but overall it was a deep, productive session worth repeating.

#### Freeflow meditation

* Tom Campbell’s binaural beats, 256-128.
* 30 minutes.
* Slipped quickly through F10 to F12, sensing my awareness expand far beyond the body.
* Asked again, *“What is the frequency of my field?”* and waited.
* Dark, luminous waves of indigo and deep violet moved through my vision like slow tides, soothing and immersive.
* I thanked the experience, then shifted into F15 for manifesting work and closed the session by moving backward through F15 → F12 → F10 → wakefulness. The reverse transitions always feel remarkable.

#### Transitional lucid dream

* Drifted into sleep with the intent to become lucid and project.
* Became lucid mid-dream, walking through the kitchen. Awareness made the environment unstable, as if the scene itself knew it wasn’t real.
* Remembered my goal and said aloud, *“Project inward, I am going inward.”*
* Darkness surrounded me as I descended into a familiar black void, vibrations rising until the state faded.
* Still, a clear and progressive chain of altered states, good work overall.

#### Liminal

* As the altered state faded, a liminal appeared in the lower right of my field.
* Difficult to define: a dark structure with blocky upper sections edged in neon-mint filaments, reminiscent of tritium vials.
* It shrank out of sight after a short display.

#### Numbers

* Glancing at my watch afterward, it read 3:33.
* A callback to the early-year entry where “333” appeared written by an unseen hand.
* I take it as confirmation I’m on the right track.

### October 18, 2025

#### Meditation

* William Buhlman “The Target” method.
* 30 minutes.
* Set the intention: *“Now I am out of my body.”*
* Focused on familiar targets, including my Ti Arto pen resting on the green Moleskine at my desk.
* Went deep again, though the usual minor twitches interrupted a few times. I’ll need to find a better way to calm those “body checks.”

#### Freeflow meditation

* Tom Campbell’s binaural beats, 256-128.
* 30 minutes.
* Transitioned smoothly into F10 then F12.
* Asked again, *“What is the frequency of my field?”*
* Saw a luminous indigo-purple area appear, third session this week with similar visuals.
* Logging indigo/deep purple as my baseline resonance.
* Moved into F15 for another round of manifesting.

#### Lucid dream

* Fell asleep quickly.
* Found myself lucid in the garage, lights glowing orange. I laughed as I floated off the ground, throwing a few mock punches and kicks for no reason other than amusement.
* As the scene dissolved, I turned awareness inward and felt the rush of transition before waking.

#### Liminal

* Another appeared, this one pale and shifting, white-grey blotches drifting at the edge of sight before fading. Subtle, but still noted.

### October 19, 2025

#### Freeflow meditation

* Tom Campbell’s binaural beats, 256-128-64.
* 30 minutes.
* Reached F10, then F12.
* Asked once more, *“What is the frequency of my field?”*
* The same indigo and deep-violet waves formed, this time from the right side.
* Noted faint, rapid vibrations near the third knuckle on my right hand (likely physical, but worth logging).
* Ended in F15 and closed the session feeling refreshed. A longer version of this track (45–60 minutes) may yield stronger results.
