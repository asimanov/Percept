### Who Do You Want To Be Next Month?

**Early on in working through The Gateway Experience tapes, a particular session became an instant staple in my practice, just like for many others. There are other tracks throughout the entire program which I've identified as "practical" and continue to return to, but this one takes the prize for most used. I'm talking about "The Gateway Experience -- Wave II - Threshold -- One-Month Patterning".**

This guide applies to **"Wave IV - Adventure -- One Year Patterning"** as well. The main difference is the scope of change. It goes without saying that a little more thinking and clarity is required for the one-year pattern than one month, but the categories within which you will be working are the same for both.

#### Why am I writing this guide?

With the first month of the new year halfway through, a little voice, subconscious, in my mind nudged me to open this track again as it's been a while. The way I like to approach these sessions is to think deeply about what I want to manifest, complete the meditation, and promptly forget all about what I patterned (more on that later). 

While getting my thoughts together before diving in, I realized the common struggle among many who do these sessions regularly: just what the heck are you supposed to do with the prompts that Bob runs you through when building this pattern? You can read the manual, which I always recommend after doing a tape for the first time, but even that material is relatively sparse for our dense Western minds. So, as I was typing it all out, I realized that I do have some wisdom or advice to impart regarding this process.

#### Do I need The Gateway Experience tapes?

No. You could simply learn the pattern categories below and meditate on them without anything. Remember: The Gateway Experience, self-hypnosis, meditation with binaural beats, basic meditation, etc. are all tools and vehicles to assist you in entering human trance. You do not *need* them. 

**Bottom line: access human trance however you like.**

#### 1 Month/Year Patterning

The goal of this guide is to provide examples of what kind of information to focus on and feeling/emotion to search for during the 1 month or 1 year patterning sessions in The Gateway Experience. Take the principles and core ideas of Neville Goddard into account: always view and envision everything as if you already have achieved it. What does that feel like? Maybe drop "as if you already have achieved it" in favor of "already have achieved it" to strengthen your visualization and emotion.

**Live in the wish fulfilled.**

**Most important of all:** This is a framework for manifesting. Even if you don't stick to these specific categories but apply the general idea to your own practice, you're still simply doing manifesting work. It might feel like a new skill, but I promise you that at some level you do this every single day without thinking much about it. What this "system" helps with is making a focused and concentrated effort with planning on what exactly and precisely you desire. In my opinion, at the very least, this prompt/example outline serves as a general guide to unpacking *just exactly* what you want when you're feeling scattered and need help untangling yourself.   

**Enough talking about it, let's get on with the action.**

#### Physical Body

##### Prompt

1. Think of your physical body. Think of the pattern that you would like your physical body to be. <br> Example: strength, flexibility, energy, physical appearance, weight, stamina, etc. 

2. Build it. Make it stronger, more and more.

3. Release this pattern and let it flow out. Let it flow out strongly and beautifully out into all parts of your expanded awareness. Into all parts and in all ways.  

##### Example

>I wish to continue to grow physically stronger and increase my stamina during long-distance running.
>
>I imagine looking at my physical body in the mirror. My shoulders are wider and more defined, individual shoulder heads separated and cut. My chest is wider and more dense. My lower arms are bigger and continue to be lean and cut. My upper arms are wider overall, with biceps and triceps having grown but also even more defined. My back is wider, stronger, and defined. My lower abs are as defined as upper and mid abs, obliques outline them. My legs and backside are stronger and more muscular. My traps have grown to fit this new configuration. 
>
>I then observe myself lifting and running. While running, I notice that hitting uphill climbs does not slow me down and my battery doesn't weaken as fast, allowing me to run longer and stronger. 
>
>**Now, I am that.**

#### Mental Self

##### Prompt

1. Now form a pattern of your mental self and put it into your center of consciousness. 
<br>Example: focus, creativity, calm under pressure, the attributes that make your physical mind and positively influence the ego.

2. Build it. Make it stronger, more and more. 

3. Now release the pattern, let it flow out strongly and surely into all parts of your expanded awareness, out in all directions and in all ways.

Release the pattern, letting it flow through your mind and wider awareness.

##### Example

> My goal is to continue to bolster, reinforce, and build up metacognitive control.
>
>I feel calm and stillness in the midst of chaos. Shadows and people are swirling all around me, but I am unperturbed. When someone or something, deliberately or by accident, moves to disturb my inner peace, I do not react. I observe and do not judge. I only move and act on any one thing if my actions and words improve myself and the wellbeing of the collective state. I am calm, focused, creative, and unreactive. 
>
>**Now, I am that.** 

---

#### Emotional Self

##### Prompt

1. Think of a pattern for your emotional self as you desire it, move it deeply into your consciousness. 
<br>
Example: balance, resilience, empathy, love. How do you view yourself as a total human, what language and emotions arise when you think of yourself and things that you do. What emotional view do you hold toward anyone outside of yourself? 

2. Build it. Make it stronger, more and more.

3. Now release the pattern. Let it flow out. Push it out strongly and surely into all parts of your expanded awareness. In all directions and in all ways.

##### Example

>Little mistakes and annoyances hold no power over my emotional state. I see myself dropping a cup of water on the floor and smiling in response as I clean up the mess. Bigger annoyances and disturbances have little to no effect on my emotional state. I hear my youngest son crying and moaning about something completely unthreatening and ridiculous. I let it pass without emotion or a response. 
>
>**Now, I am that.**

#### Greater Self

##### Prompt

1. Now form the pattern in your center of consciousness of your greater self as you desire it.
<br>
Example: Envision your "greater self" beyond physical, mental, and emotional boundaries.

2. Build it. Make it stronger, more and more.

3. Release the pattern. Let it flow out. Push it out strongly and surely into all parts of your expanded awareness. In all directions, in all ways.

##### Example

>I perceive my greater self as boundless energy: an inner core of unshakable strength that goes beyond physical and local reality. I see my current state of being as a node which is part of the larger Higher Self. My experience, gratitude, and love permeate every part of my infinite and total Self. My energy stretches into and beyond nonlocal and subtle spaces. I am able to tap into the deeper well of power at will. I give and receive all energy. 
>
>**Now, I am that.**

#### Where You Desire to Be

##### Prompt

1. Create the pattern in your mind and deep in the center of your consciousness as to where you desire to be.
<br>
Picture the location or life situation that you want. Example: physical place, life circumstance, emotional state.

2. Build it. Make it stronger, more and more.

3. Release this pattern of where you desire to be. Push it far out into your expanded awareness in all directions, in all ways.

##### Example

>I find myself surrounded by my family in our safe, comfortable, and empowering dwelling. My children and wife are happy and laughing, busy with their own important and fulfilling hobbies and adventures. I am with them: building Legos, reading books, improving the house, being intimate. I am at ease, relaxed, open, and curious. 
>
>**Now, I am that.** 

---

#### What You Desire to Do

##### Prompt

1. Create the pattern of what you desire to do and push it deep into the center of your consciousness.
<br>
Clarify the specific action(s) or project(s) you want to pursue. Example: Write a book, learn a new skill, travel, finish a project.

2. Build it. Make it stronger, more and more.

3. Release this pattern of what you desire to do. Let it flow out now. Push it out strongly and surely into all parts of your expanded awareness. In all directions. In all ways.

##### Example

>I am sending off a project closure report on a major upgrade to a system that I have built and manage. I feel light and content as if the task was a breeze, even though it most definitely proved to be a formidable challenge. I explain how I transformed this situation into an opportunity and look forward to the next challenge. I am viewed by my peers and supervising entities as more than capable, industrious, persevering, and a leader in technical and human affairs.  
>
>**Now, I am that.**

#### What You Desire to Achieve

##### Prompt

1. Create the pattern of what you desire to achieve and move it deep into the center of your consciousness.
<br>
Specify a clear goal or achievement. Example: Reach a certain milestone in my career, improve my health metrics, expand my readership.

2. Build it. Make it stronger, more and more. This desire of what you need to achieve.

3. Release the pattern, let it flow out. Push it out strongly and surely into all parts of your expanded awareness. In all directions and in all ways.

##### Example

>I have arrived at a unique and reliably reproducible illustration style that underscores and compliments my ontology and thinking, represents Percept Index beautifully, is natural and fun to create as well as to work with, and most importantly ties my writing and mission together like a beautiful rug completes a room. I know it's the right direction and my readership reflects it in growth and engagement.  
>
>**Now, I am that.** 

---

#### Rest In Your Awareness

> Relax and realize that the total pattern is complete that you have created for you and your existence. Relax and feel calm and comfortable with the knowledge that you have built new patterns.

-- Robert Monroe

#### A Word Of Advice

Think deeply and carefully about what you want. What you pattern and draw to yourself during this manifestation practice will come to you. You cannot manifest something which infringes on others' free will. Something like that takes real effort, intention, and lots of karma. Be sure to pattern for yourself. In the examples, you can see that you can affect others with how you change. Change in a positive direction and betterment of all is amplified. Stepping on others' free will will stagnate and fail. 

After you're done outlining, forget it. It won't help to sit there and read it right before the meditation the same way cramming for an exam 5 minutes before it starts doesn't improve your score. In fact, it'll likely backfire. You think and outline to prepare, trust yourself that you're prepared and know what to do/feel/manifest when called to do it. **Trust yourself** that you're always ready, no matter what happens. 

> Now, I am that.

Why am I ending every example with that line? There's some debate if this is a well-known saying by Neville Goddard or mostly ignored by everyone. With this deterministic line, you are making a concrete statement to your subconscious and the universe that this is **now you**. Not only that, but I found that releasing the pattern with this statement makes the most sense and impact. You're sending out what you're manifesting to all parts of your consciousness and the universe as a whole, "This is now who I am, now I am that." 

As you declare **"Now, I am that,"** truly feel it, believe it with everything you've got, don't hesitate. 

Something else that I found important: after the session is over, completely forget everything that you patterned. You really should work on letting go and immediately forgetting during the meditation itself when you release the pattern. How the wish or pattern manifests isn't important and, in fact, can and will get in the way of receiving that which you desire. Go on with your day, play with the dog, write a poem, do your laundry, whatever it is that you have to do. Just remember that this process is done and be at peace.
