### November 3, 2025

#### 5:40 PM

* Bright green shooting star moving from east to west.
* I viewed it for about five seconds or a little longer from the parking lot of the agency where I work.
* Same exact experience and visual as the one I witnessed four weeks ago on [20251009](https://perceptindex.com/journal/20251012/#evening-walk "20251009").

### November 5, 2025

#### Meditation

* Mid-week chakra balancing.
* Very deep, very relaxing, rebalanced.

#### Lucid Dream → Projection

* Quick nap to energize.
* Before closing my eyes I laid down and set my intent using all the intent-setting principles I’ve written about.
* The intent itself was something like, “NOW I am having a conscious out-of-body experience, NOW I am out of body.”
* I was seeing if I could skip over the lucid dream portion of my usual approach.
* Not sure how long I was in the dream, but after a while I became lucid.
* When lucidity comes in dreams like this, it’s not the same as a typical lucid dream. It tends to degrade quickly and doesn’t have that crisp, waking-life fidelity.
* Once I became lucid, I instantly remembered my intent and fell backward onto my back.
* After initiating the falling sensation, I was enveloped in darkness and then emerged falling backward, though facing forward toward my momentum (weird), inside of a portal or wormhole.
* I was gaining speed, and this time the portal was lighter than absolute darkness, with streaks of bright colors and an overall soft, warm, glowing backdrop.
* I voiced, “I accept,” as I moved through it, then began to slow before coming to a stop.
* My vision filled with this warm, glowing light that gently dissipated as I woke up in my office.
* What worked here, as in my usual process, seems to be the same key: setting intent. Not surprising, but good to verify.
* Why did it end? Like other recent projections, I entered the tunnel or wormhole and it was great (fun and vivid) but it just ended with me waking up.
* Is “Now I am out of my body” too generic? Do I need to be more specific about where I want to go? If so, I have a problem: how do I know where to go if I don’t know what’s possible or what the destination is even called?
* I should meditate on this.
* One more note: at the end, I had a brief visit from *something*. I thought I was about to see a Liminal, which are always fun, but instead I saw a creature with gray, sickly-looking skin. It was lying down in a hunched position, very thin and frail. The expression on its face was both surprised and fearful. It was bald, with large eyes and visible ribs. I felt like I was looking at Gollum waking up from a nap in his cave. I called to it, letting it know I wasn’t afraid and that it shouldn’t fear me (I wasn’t going to hurt it). The creature twitched, then used one leg to scoot out of view before disappearing. Odd. I still feel sadness when thinking about that moment.

#### 10:35 PM

* As I was falling asleep, a curious thing happened.
* Typically, at bedtime I’m dazzled by an uptick in phosphene activity. It’s similar to what I see during meditation but more complex: different shapes, tunnels, patterns, fields of stars. I look forward to it every evening.
* As usual, I enjoyed the phosphene show as it built to a finale and faded away.
* Before the finale, some darker phosphene blobs were parted by a beam of iridescent light coming from above, into the location of my third eye (between the brows).
* I’ve seen this beam before during a wild chakra-balancing meditation a couple months ago. The meditation itself was self-hypnosis, but the beam and vortex of colors as it moved from top chakra to root were wild. I wasn’t directing any of it.
* The finale this time was interesting: the color blobs expanded and contracted toward me. Normally they grow out of the darkness, linger, fade, and combine, but this time they seemed to come from a source (maybe the beam) and flowed directly into me, like energetic waves swelling from behind and tapering inward as they dove into me.
* A moment after it faded, my entire field of view (behind closed eyes) turned seafoam green, or turquoise, for about two seconds.
* At the same moment, I heard an electronic buzz, like something powering on quickly. A deep, short burst of sound.
* Then everything returned to calm darkness. I fell asleep without incident.
* I jot these things down because I don’t want to forget, though the irony is that I couldn’t forget even if I tried. Experiences like these tend to stay vivid.

### November 7, 2025

#### Meditation

* 30 minutes.
* Tom Campbell’s binaural beats “256-128-64.”
* A relaxing meditation with some manifesting work in F15.
* Caught myself clicking out a couple times toward the end, so I exited the session and felt refreshed.
* Most sessions are like this. Not every one needs to have action or novelty.

### November 8, 2025

#### Meditation

* 30 minutes.
* Tom Campbell’s binaural beats “256-128-64.”
* This one was a bit odd.
* Everything went fine at first, but after relaxing and falling away in F10, a loud sound suddenly came from my headphones.
* It was a chime with rapid “beeps,” lasting about three seconds.
* It sounded like it came from the headphones, and while I assume that’s the case, I’ve never heard anything like it before and I’ve used these headphones for over a year and a half.
* They’re wired over-ear headphones, so Bluetooth issues weren’t involved.
* I tried a new intent-setting script and feel good about it.
* It didn’t yield results this time, but I’m confident in it.
* Had a hard time falling asleep afterward to get the desired action going. I use earplugs for afternoon sessions since the kids (mostly Ivan, who’s almost three and quite the presence) can make noise that even my trusty white/pink noise machine can’t cover. These earplugs make a rubbing sound against the pillow when I lie on my side. Not ideal. I’ll find a fix.

### November 9, 2025

#### Meditation

* 45 minutes.
* Expand app, timer function, Focus 21, set meditation length and focus level for binaural beats.
* Set intention before prep.
* Prep stage went fine as usual.
* Reached F10 quickly, moved into F12 briefly, then spent most of the session in F15 doing manifestation work. I had the energy for longer and more focused visualization this time.
* Afterward, I gave thanks and moved back to F10, repeating my intent:
  “Now I am having a conscious out-of-body experience. Now I am out of body. Now I am out of body and stable in the state of exploration. Now, take me to the place where I learn about myself. Now, I am lucid and resting in awareness. I trust myself and the process. And so it is.”
* I like how Dick Sutphen ends his post-hypnotic suggestions with “and so it is,” so I’ve been using that for about a month now.

#### Projection

* I rolled over and got comfortable.
* I drifted off quickly, letting sleep come while staying observant.
* As I approached the edge of consciousness, I repeated, “Now I am out of my body,” as my last conscious thought.
* I became aware as I was walking out of the garage and into the main hallway of my house: crystal-clear, waking-life fidelity, indistinguishable from physical reality.
* The door to the office was open, and bright, warm yellow light poured out. It was the most brightly lit room in the house from where I stood.
* I walked toward the office and entered.
* The ottoman was open, and the daybed was folded out. I was definitely projecting, but I didn’t see my body lying there. Sometimes I do, but often I don’t. The window shutters were closed.
* Because I didn’t see my body, I didn’t immediately think, “Wrong direction, go the other way.”
* Instead, I gently lifted into the air: the smoothest floating movement I’ve ever had. Then, with the same effortless control, I rose further and drifted toward the office window. The motion was calm and deliberate, the glide natural.
* I reached the window, shutters still closed, and remembered my intent: “Take me to the place where I learn about myself.”
* Wooshing sounds began, my vision dimmed, lights flickered through the white shutters.
* That’s as far as it went. I began to fade and felt myself settle gently onto the daybed.
* I didn’t want to open my eyes and nearly initiated separation again, but in the lower-right of my field of view, another Liminal began to form.
* It appeared as white and pastel-colored clouds, expanding and contracting as if about to solidify. A few “solid” fragments appeared before it sputtered and dissolved.
* This is the second time a Liminal in that in-between state has seemed to have low energy, struggling to materialize. Interesting.
