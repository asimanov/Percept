### January 14, 2026

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation 

- 30 Minutes.
- Expand app, timer section, Focus 15.
- I'm a little surprised I didn't spring for chakra balancing but that's ok, just wasn't feeling it today. 
- Energy is neutral today, however the morning run was a bit difficult.
- Prep went fine, no issues.
- As soon as I entered F10 I clicked out. I believe at least 10 minutes, one of the longest click outs I've had. Usually I expect these when getting used to a frequency but they do happen from time to time at any given focus level. 
- While in F15 I communicated to my subconscious and higher self "what do I need to know about trust?" This has been on my mind since Sunday's Jungian dream after meditation session.

- Ran into a skunk on my morning run.

#### Evening

##### Hypnagogia 

- When I laid down to close my eyes the phosphene activity jumped straight into action. I'm starting to track this because it might correlate with added contact/interactions. For the record, phosphene activity usually takes a little bit of time to get going. 
- Among the flurry of activity I spotted a bright pinhole, brightest object during the phosphene show.
- This time the white pinhole light came from middle-right of my field of view.
- It grew, vanished, grew again, vanished, and finally a purple shape appeared as it floated towards me and then finally pulled back and out of view.
- The shape of the object was very similar to the "electric jellyfish" from last week but not quite the same. It was also harder to see since the purple color isn't neon, against a dark/black background that's a bit difficult to distinguish.
- There was movement though and that's how I was able to track it.
- Once again, very similar to Liminal contact in the in-between states considering the duration of display. 
- Unlike the Liminals these continue to display behavior of something that's checking me out, maybe I'm new to them too, or novel, I don't know.

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation 

- 30 Minutes.
- Dick Sutphen, guided self-hypnosis, chakra balancing. 
- Stayed very awake and aware for the majority of the session.
- Toward the end I did space out for a bit but as you can tell by the frequency of click outs, these things are uncommon. 
- Spinal vibrations during the countdown to deeper levels and then again after I came to from the click out. 
- As usual, felt light and refreshed after the session.

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation 

- 30 Minutes.
- Expand App, timer section, Focus 12.
- Needed to switch it up a bit and do a little bit of problem solving, or priming for it. I do plan on doing a longer session at another time regarding this topic but when I'm short on time I'll throw it out there in F12. The beauty of this method is that, at least in my experience, the answer seldom comes right then and there but rather takes a little time to unfold and eventually presents itself in waking life, dreams, altered states, etc. 
- I pitched, "What do I need to understand about trust? What's preventing me from fully trusting?" Yeah, general, my conundrum is general too since... I really don't have specifics to work with. 
- Shortly after I had a few hypnagogic visions, nothing jumped out immediately, probably mostly processing. 
- Overall nice session, ended it after 27 minutes clear and awake.

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation 

- 40 Minutes.
- The Gateway Experience, Wave II - Threshold, One-Month Patterning.
- Early on in working through these tapes this particular session became an instant staple in my practice, just like for many others. Over time and with changing focus I lost track of which months I'd do this session. 
- It's been a long time since I've done a patterning meditation. The last one I did was of one year pattern, which is basically the same as one month but with a broader perspective. 
- With the first month of the new year halfway through a little voice, subconscious, in my mind nudged me to open this track and do it.
- While getting my thoughts together before diving in I realized the common struggle among many who do this session regularly: just what the heck are you supposed to do with the prompts that Bob runs you through when building this pattern? You can read the manual, which I always recommend after doing a tape for the first time, but even that material is relatively sparse for our dense Western minds. So, as I was typing it all out I realized that I do have some wisdom or advice to impart regarding this process. 
- Feature journal entry outlining the steps and what to look for coming up later this week!
- Overall the session went beautifully. 
- 0 click outs, though at every stage I felt the pull but something assisted in pushing me out of near slumber. It's the subconscious, it's usually almost always the subconscious. Also, I don't want to be too mystical about it, when I say "subconscious" I mean it at face value and at the same time I mean "you". You are both consciousness and subconsciousness, separation is an illusion but in this case and regarding our total being it's a very efficacious one. 
- After the meditation was over I attempted an altered state experience but ultimately just went in and out of light sleep for a little over half an hour. All good, next time!

- The Seattle Seahawks move on to 2025 NFC Championship!

### January 18, 2026

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation 

- 40 Minutes.
- Expand app, timer section, Focus 21.
- Gave myself some time before getting back into F21, today was a nice opportunity to do that again. 
- Spent a little too much time in F10 and F12, for whatever reason this has been a kind of normal occurrence lately. Need to address this, or not. Something I wonder if we mistakenly think something needs to be fixed when things change. After all, reality is change, acceptance of change frees us up to flow in harmony. I should take the advice and lesson that the Universe is handing me. 
- Come to think of it, I'm spending more time in F10 and F12 because maybe I need to. Maybe I need to reacclimate after disrupting my practice. 
- Once in F21 I went in and out of a few sequences but nothing that jumps out, need to spend more energy bolstering awareness during these moments. 
- Did a little bit of manifestation work in F15 on my way out.
- Stopped in F12 and offered to connect, as I usually do.
- Finally said my physical affirmation in F10 as well as set my intent for a lucid dream.

##### Lucid(ish) Dream

- The altered state exploration is still warming back up and getting going after the psilocybin trip. That's probably the only thing I can caution about cubensis, it appears after a decent-sized trip the faculties with which you access altered states tend to take time to come back. The trade-off is heightened introspection, magnificent intuition, superior shadow work and integration, etc. So, I'm saying that it's worth it but don't be surprised if a month or so passes with lackluster results when it comes to lucid dreams and astral projection. 
- This was an interesting one, and kind of a funny one. I keep getting a feeling that subconscious is doing little tests to see if I'm fully back and aware in subtle spaces.
- I became lucid while walking down a hallway in the Agency office for which I work. 
- In front of me was someone familiar but didn't realize that I was walking behind them.
- Right then and there I said, "I'm gonna getchu!" I don't know why. Why would I say this? This isn't one of my kids, specifically this isn't my 3 year old walking down the hallway. 
- The familiar person turned around but wasn't who I thought it was. I still know this person, also a friend, but dang here I am getting people wrong and talking to them like they're a toddler.
- As they turned around they were a good sport about it and we both laughed.
- I used my badge to open the door for them and then continued on out of the building. 
- The dream disintegrated at this point. It wasn't a full and lucid breakdown like I'm used to but had similar elements to it. This makes me think that my state of awareness in subtle spaces is still working to make its way back. I typically experience the entire breakdown, I've trained this, but today felt like 50% or maybe a little more.
- Lastly a Liminal did appear but was once again hard to see.
- It was translucent, like "liquid glass", geometric, flat, with little depth. It was moving, they're always in constant motion. 
- Nevertheless, I set my intent and received an experience, no matter how small and incomplete it felt. Good stuff!
