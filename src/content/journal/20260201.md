### 20260128

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation 

- 30 minutes.
- One of Dick Sutphen's chakra balancing tracks.
- Very busy and somewhat stressful day, so the mid-week chakra balancing session was a welcomed moment to stop, let go, and let someone else guide. 
- Normal glitches today, white strobing from behind the eyes. Loosely tracking this; appears to happen when approaching certain states.

### 20260129

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation 

- 25 minutes.
- Expand App, timer section, Focus 18.
- It's been a busy day with some unexpected situations.
- Sometimes days like this work to my advantage as I'm not at all priming my mind for anything before lying down for a session. This has proven to result in *nearly* spontaneous projections. 
- Today I had no such luck, but that's okay! It wasn't meant for today.
- I spent the majority of my time lazily moving through focus levels until resting for about half the meditation in Focus 18.
- I'm starting to refer to these types of meditations as my "lazy river." After all, I end up doing some sort of manifestation work at the end or core of the session, and if we get technical, that means I'm interacting with the "event stream." It's not a clean statement, but I'll allow myself this one.

### 20260130

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation 

- 30 minutes.
- Custom file that combines Tom Campbell's binaural beats with aspects of Gateway Tapes. Interesting, but I'm not used to the higher pitch that was chosen from Campbell's collection. 
- Not the most fluid transitions, but nothing I can't learn to expect after a few rounds.
- I need to run this track at its full length of 60 minutes; 30 just wasn't long enough.
- Nothing crazy with this one. I let it run and just observed. Nearly fell asleep towards the end if my headphones hadn't spazzed out. 
- Couple of glitches involving rapid and intense white strobes emanating from behind the eyes. Not the usual *feel* of these glitches. Interesting nonetheless. 
- One more pass with this one tomorrow before I decide to keep or ditch the track.
- By the way, if anyone has a specific track they like or are interested in but want an opinion on, send it my way. I'll try just about anything and report back on my experience and findings.

### 20260131

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation

- 45 minutes.
- Tom Campbell's binaural beats, 128-64. Something a little different than my usual 256-128-64.
- No particular goal today, but developed one for future sessions.
- Worked my way from F10 to F15 without incident.
- In F12, I declared myself and extended contact invitation in any way. Didn't spend much time here today.
- Once in F15, I had a strong body check in the form of left foot twitch. It's always the left foot.
- Defaulted to some loose manifestation work in F15. Full details on this one are coming in a feature entry later this week.
- Finished with a declaration: "Now I am that."
- I was thinking about exploring past life events or reliving key moments, but something told me I didn't have enough time. Said my gratitude and made my exit out of F15 to briefly rest in F10.
- In F10, besides my usual physical body affirmation, I set my intent for altered state exploration.
- Said my final thanks and counted '1.'

##### Projection

- My personal method continues to evolve.
- After I rolled over and closed my eyes, I felt the call of sandman. It was a while before I felt drowsy. Kept snapping back a couple of times before slipping through on the third approach, still aware of the transition.
- The dream was short, a minute or two at most.
- As soon as I was lucid, I began my "spiral" out of the dream. 90% of the practice is mindful inaction, but that doesn't mean never taking action. You have to be mindful of that too. "Let go and flow."
- Etheric eyes opened buttery smooth and fast.
- I was hovering above my body, facing the ceiling of my office.
- The office looked normal for the most part. More light than in waking awareness, pretty typical of my office projections. No sound at all, which is notable since the Dohm is always running.
- One anomaly worth noting: the ceiling fan was completely different. Full details on this one are in the feature entry.
- Attempted to move but hit resistance, like I was tethered to my body. Tried turning left and right but kept snapping back. This went on for a couple of minutes until my energy waned.
- Calmed down and let myself exit naturally. Closed my etheric eyes and settled back in gently, as has become the norm.
- Before the projection, while still in F10, I did a small bit of energy work testing a hypothesis. Next session, I'm going to focus on energy work directly, spend most of my time amping it up and moving it around. Goal is a sort of "energy stretching" before my next projection attempt.

### 20260201

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation 

- 30 minutes.
- Tom Campbell's binaural beats, 64-32. 
- Today's goal was to move to a different set of carrier frequencies and see how that would aid (or not) my preparation for projection. The other goal was to focus on energy work as a means of "energy stretching" before projecting. 
- Against my best intentions, I was distracted for this session, and the energy work could have gone much better. 
- I did not end up projecting, no lucid dream, and much less I don't think I ever truly fell asleep either.
- Today's session was fine but could have been better. Right before I laid down to get going, the power went out. My youngest boy wasn't having any of it since his sound machine turned off, and that's a big deal for a 3-year-old. My oldest boy was sarcastic and annoyed. Kim was woken up from her nap. One of the dogs was very concerned. Needless to say, the house was not its usual quiet and tranquil self. Once the power was restored and everyone was sorted out, I already lost about half an hour of my time. It's okay, things happen. Today was just not ideal. 
- Another note on today: It seems like Sundays in particular are weird. Either something doesn't align and sessions are "meh," or while everything goes well, nothing worthwhile happens. Meditation is a shell of its usual self, and altered states either fizzle out quick or never happen. I've been thinking about this for a few weeks, and I think I've come to a conclusion: it's not *the day*, it's ***my belief*** that *this day* sucks for my practice, so I unknowingly expect it to go a certain way and so it does. Limiting beliefs can be just as insidious as fears.
