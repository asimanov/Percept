### No One Is Coming

##### On prophecy as control mechanism

**The most dangerous prophecy doesn't fail to come true—it's specifically designed to keep you waiting forever. When you convince people that salvation comes from outside, that they need to wait for someone else to fix things, to save them, to reveal truth, you've built the perfect control system. One that runs on hope turned into passivity.**

While on my run this morning I was mulling over some relatively important decisions that I'm being drawn to make. During this train of thought, and without giving too much away, I began contemplating the return of Jesus Christ (the Second Coming or Parousia), a foundational prophecy and doctrine of Christianity. Specifically I was looking at this from the perspective of current macro events.

And when you look at what's happening right now, it's hard not to notice the pattern. Everything that is corrupt is becoming more corrupt and it's all out in the open. Collectively we, the masses, are waking up again to brutal and shocking truths of how our current reality is controlled and managed by what I can only describe as less-than-moral and downright evil individuals and groups.

Sounds like the time is ripe for an apocalypse, and it's becoming increasingly obvious that we should be looking at that term in its original meaning: an "uncovering," "revelation," or "lifting of the veil"—a disclosure of hidden knowledge rather than the modern connotation of destruction and death.

Why am I going on about this? Because that's what human egos turned Christ's messages and teachings into. They flipped the empowering truths and revelations of reality that he brought forth into fear-based control systems designed to hold you in place.

Christ isn't returning. Christ Consciousness has already been given to you. Direct knowing is accessible—you don't need permission or intermediaries to access it. Authority is a performance, and the kingdom of heaven operational framework was always available. It was never about waiting for someone else to save you.

Things are bad, they'll probably get worse, but in the process of worldwide enshittification more people are waking up. To what? To the lies, seeking truth, finding it, learning it, and choosing to live in the present, in the now.

Here's the part that's hard to digest: the same structures claiming to protect and guide us have been actively inverting empowerment into dependency. The inversion is insidious. Take an empowerment technology (Christ Consciousness as direct access to non-local reality) and weaponize it into passivity by externalizing the source. "Wait for salvation" replaces "you have the kingdom within you." The prophecy itself becomes the control mechanism.

When you teach people that their direct experience is suspect, that truth comes only through approved channels, that sovereignty is arrogance, you've created exactly the conditions for institutional evil to flourish unchecked. Because who can challenge it?

When enough individuals stop waiting for external salvation and start operating from direct knowing, the control mechanisms lose capture.

No one is coming to save us. Buddha taught awakening through direct practice. Lao Tzu pointed to the Way that can't be mediated by authority. Christ demonstrated consciousness technology in action. They gave us wisdom—practical methods for direct knowing. We let egos muddy the waters and seize control, trading our collective sovereignty for the illusion of comfort and security. That's how we allowed evil to rule.

The gift wasn't the promise of a return—that's the lie.

The gift is realization of the Kingdom Within.
