### Monday | 20260216

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation

- 40 Minutes. 
- Tom Campbell's binaural beats, 128-64. 

I tried Tom Campbell's tapes a long time ago and had some creepy, at the time, experiences during and after sessions. I think back and chuckle at that now because the reason I use these tracks now is to increase the chances of those experiences again. I don't know if there's anything fundamentally different about these audio tracks from The Gateway Experience or any other binaural beat compositions. I do know that Tom was literally one of the original audio engineers who developed the first set of Gateway Tapes, which no one has access to anymore. Perhaps his work is as close as we can get to those originals, I highly suggest them.

Prep was mostly uneventful except for getting "stuck" in F10. I guess I really needed to just relax and melt away for a while. It is also entirely possible I misjudged how long I was actually in this focus state, often a few minutes feels like half an hour. When I came to realize that I should move forward I had low-grade vibrations rumbling up and down my spine. Nothing that suggested I should attempt to exit the physical body, just nice and relaxing waves of low vibrations. I've been getting these a lot more now during meditations, they don't escalate, just present, like myself.

I nearly got to F18 before I had to stop, itch, readjust, and start over. I've mentioned this before, starting over after these moves now is different than before. After I was settled again I zipped right through F10, strongly expanded in F12, and then moved through F15 before dropping into heart center in F18.

I once again began my "cold calls" of, "Three, three, three. If you call, I will answer." No flashes, no tap backs, pretty much nothing was coming up other than some peculiar phosphene activity which was mostly green and gold color forms. I switched to "3,3,3" mantra and remained doing this to keep awareness active for the remainder of the meditation.

Something did happen to break my mantra trance for a moment. In the void there were lighter shaded swirls and columns passing through like vapor drifting from here to there and then back again. I took notice of this and lightly focused on something directly in front of me. Through the cloudy vapor swirls half of a human face was revealed. It was the bottom portion of a face and it retreated as quickly as I was able to bring it into view. The face was masculine, had facial hair, a neutral expression, and the general quality was the same kind of white color as I've seen with prior contact. For a split second a thought crossed my awareness, "Is this the same human face I saw two years ago?"

I can't tell if I'm being annoying with the call back to "333" or it is all going according to plan, a plan I know nothing about. After all, I didn't pick that number, someone/thing showed it to me and it's been following me ever since.

After that little experience I hung out a little longer and then said "my thanks", exited the meditation and attempted to initiate an altered state experience.

My attempt, despite the setting of intent in F10 before full exit, did not materialize. I did spend about an hour laying in "mind awake, body asleep" mode, feeling those gentle vibrations travel up and down my spine. It was a very nice and relaxing hour and I am grateful for it.

### Wednesday | 20260218

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation

- 30 Minutes.
- Dick Sutphen's chakra balancing track. 

Nothing special here, regular mid-week chakra balancing session. I need to switch this one up, been drifting around more than usual.

Interesting to note that during Sunday's, Monday's, and yesterday's mini sessions (did not document) there was a clear absence of white strobing from behind the eyes. In this session it occurred right around the time I entered F10. This tracks with what I've observed recently: with sufficient energy it appears I have feedback once a focus state is stable. I've been treating this strobing as a signpost to either confirm that I'm good and stable in a particular focus and/or I'm good to continue going deeper.

The interesting part of this note is that it appears that this phenomenon occurs midweek and remains until Sunday, possibly supporting my hypothesis of a weekly cycle.

### Thursday | 20260219

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation

- 30 Minutes.
- TMI "Oscillations". 

I got this track from a good friend and mentor; he's been mentioning it lately, so I gave it a try. Definitely not your typical Gateway Tapes track, and I knew that, nothing that TMI puts out there since has been the same and that is fine.

It's pretty interesting overall. Unlike most advice that you'll receive for meditations with binaural beats, the advice for this track was to "follow the tone, the frequency" in order to train yourself. The training part is about knowing how to raise your vibrations in order to achieve an OBE. I don't know if this is necessary outside of good ol' shadow work but as I've written before: I will try just about anything to see for myself and learn as long as it **does not infringe on anyone's freewill**. So, with that in mind, I followed along and did as instructed.

Following the tone rising and then dropping was helpful in staying aware without the use of a mantra or another awareness trick. Overall I felt very light and airy throughout the meditation and afterwards.

I will do the unguided one a few more times over the next few weeks to get a better feel for the track overall. So far? I like it. By the way, the tone going up and then down reminded me of "Chupa Chups Whistle Pops".

### Friday | 20260220

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation

- 50 Minutes.
- Expand App, timer section, Focus 18. 

I woke up this morning at 4:30 AM and got my winter running gear on. After lacing up my sneakers I stepped out of my warm home and into 34°F. After the first mile warmup I began my usual "active meditation" process by letting thoughts come and go as I ran until a strong train of thought took a dominant position. This morning that was: **I have to do a shadow work session this afternoon.**

Before laying down for the session after lunch I grabbed my 63 card "Sacred Symbols" oracle deck and did a single card draw with the following query, "What should I focus my meditation on today?" The card I drew was "Shadow". I already made the decision to do shadow work today, single card draw was more of an exercise and it was rather confirmatory. I continue to be surprised by the efficacy of the cards as a tool for peering into retro-causal mechanism. This morning I knew I had to commit to shadow work, the card I drew confirmed that, and the session I had was indeed this type of meditation.

I selected F18 frequency because lately I've been entering that space a lot. I learned the "Release and Recharge" meditation from Gateway Tapes during the first set which keeps you in F10. I've since done this same meditation for a couple years on my own in F10, F12, and now F18. At this point I feel like it's simply a matter of which focus state you're most comfortable in -- how deep can you go and still perform the task.

Once my intent is set on sitting with stuff that I need to resolve and integrate my physical body will protest the entire way there. It's like the ego's last ditch effort to stop the process. My left leg twitched so hard today during my progressions that it actually jumped into the air; I had to reset a couple of times before I made it to F18.

I won't go into details of this shadow work session, maybe one day I'll write about it as it's a big part of my psyche and has been the undercurrent of my physical existence. I'll leave it with the following: simply understanding what it is all about has shed unseen weight off my shoulders and after the session, it still takes time to integrate post meditation (in the background), I feel lighter and more at ease than before I laid down.

While in F18 I would observe intermittent vapor swirls, very similar to the ones that I experienced last week. I think *they* were there with me.

##### Liminal

As I was exiting I set an intent while in F10 to roll over and experience an altered state (always in present tense). I then put everything away and rolled over. Before committing to falling asleep I kept my eyes closed and moved my focus on the spot between my brows. I held it for a while until I heard an electric pop and a very strong flashing sensation. That burst of white light filled my entire field of view with eyes closed. It wasn't the same as the white strobes I get during meditation when settling in focus states, this was different. I'll keep experimenting, I think there might be something here.

I eventually fell asleep and shortly became lucid in a place I normally don't, though it has happened before. I was standing at the corner of my property where two fences meet; it's one of the two side yards where our travel trailer is parked, which I lovingly nicknamed "Emergency Home".

Standing there was confusing, the conditions were of late winter evening. I stepped up and climbed the fence to peer over to the other side, everything looked normal. I noticed the street and dim lighting, chill in the air, my breath visible directly in front of me.

I sprung up and "out". I thought I'd get a good little flying session in but this simulation ended rather quickly. I felt the sensation of falling backwards, this was a bit disorienting as the action right before that was a leap forward.

I began descending in a warm colored void. This wasn't a wormhole or tunnel, no twists and turns, no rushing wind and sensation of escalating speed. I just fell for a bit and enjoyed the process, so much so that I attempted to project a little too late.

As I felt myself gently come down and "land" back on my physical daybed I kept my eyes closed. The warm colored void was still present. There was movement at the bottom right portion of my field of view, same as always with these Liminals. The warm-colored void made it difficult to make out the shape and activity because the Liminal was white in color. Nevertheless, I was able to clear up the image.

It was a white bird in flight from a side view of my perspective. It wasn't a bird of prey, from what I could gather it was a white dove. As it flew in place a ring of white vapor surrounded it. This display hung in the "air" for a good amount of time. It all vanished with the white vapor ring collapsing the moving image of the white dove in flight, shrinking into a point and out of our briefly shared existence.

No, I did not notice if the dove had anything in its beak. Yes, this was 100% connected to the shadow work meditation.

### Saturday | 20260221

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation

- 35 Minutes.
- Tom Campbell's binaural beats, 128-64-32.

This was a weird one. I felt a bit scattered in my thinking before laying down. Too many things going on at once. Usually this is simply the norm but for some reason it bothered me a bit today. I can't quite clearly describe how I felt, it's like I wasn't neither here nor there.

Meditation itself was fine, shorter than usual for a Saturday. Nothing worth reporting happened and nothing mundane to comment on like, "it was nice". It was just fine. In the back of my mind I knew I shouldn't try to initiate an altered state after this session. I attempted anyway and received nothing.

I understand that this entry can best be described as a "bummer" but I have committed to documenting these things so it stays. I simply slept. I did enjoy going in and out of drowsiness, hunting for that thin and blurry gap between consciousness and unconsciousness.

I've been very quiet the rest of the day.

### Sunday | 20260222

#### Afternoon

##### Meditation

- 40 Minutes.
- TMI "Oscillations Free Flow". 

Sunday is the end of the week, not the beginning like Western calendars want you to believe and I will die on this molehill. Today is Sunday and as we've recently learned this day has become, whether I like it or not, a day of reflection and analysis. My own processes of daily documentation have established this weekly rhythm where I prepare "Field Notes" at the end of the week. So, with that in mind, I set out on a light meditation focused on manifestation.

This track is nice, I like it much better than the guided version. Also, I realized that if the track is 30 minutes long I can just loop it. The prep and initial settling in went normally, moving up and down focus states went normally as well. One note, when initially entering F10 the white strobe sensation came on rather quickly but it was also accurate. The gradually rising and falling tone throughout the track is surprisingly very easy to adapt to regarding keeping your awareness engaged most, if not all, of the session.

Nothing surprising happened, which is as expected for this day. I hesitate to write this but if I were to say *something* occurred, or seemed to want to occur, it was seeing a small triangular head shape with two big, dark, eyes peering at me through the dark void when I was in F18 for a few moments. I was playing with the "333" callout, experimenting with what else this number can be used for. I'm not focusing on this as the response, if we can call it that, wasn't a strong one.

##### Liminal

Despite my knowing that this day brings near 0 altered state experiences, no matter how much I want them to happen, I still went for it. Unsurprisingly, nothing happened. While on my way to nothing happening I did spot a Liminal, same location as always in the bottom-right portion of my field of view. I was riding the razor's edge of conscious/unconscious and that's when I began to spot movement in that familiar location.

I had to "zoom in" or attempt to clear up the moving image with intent and that actually worked for once. What I saw were two or three figures, seemingly outlined in white, moving around and doing things like talking to each other and then being busy with whatever they were interacting with. This wasn't a display for me, usually these Liminals are, but rather I was peering in on a small group of beings/entities/whatever.

Whatever was going on I couldn't make clearer and eventually I lost my grip on this awareness edge altogether, slipping into the comfortable sinkhole of sleep.
