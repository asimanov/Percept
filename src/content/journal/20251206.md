### Spherical Energy Outline

**Field Notes entries focus on brevity and getting to the point of the particular session or experience that was had. They also include other events that happen which seem to be out of the norm; they're worth recording in case we can spot a connection or simply to document. What I seldom ever do is discuss my own base process and how I go about getting my meditations started. In today's longform journal entry, I will be outlining what I do as my meditation starts and the phenomena that I've been tracking for the last 6 months, which I'm finally deciding to write about.**

#### The Preparatory Process 

It's the afternoon and I'm not working at nor connecting to my employer's network, which means I have time for proper consciousness exploration. I mentally set a timer for 50 minutes and open the Expand App, navigate to the timer section, and select Focus 21. Before starting the audio, I note that I am awake and alert, plenty of energy but a little tired, which is ideal. For 5 minutes I lay in silence and set my intention for the meditation, then I put the headphones and eye mask on and press "play".

##### Meditation Initiation 

I visualize a green and gold door in darkness. As I open the door, I see that I'm at the shoreline of some coast and it's overcast. There are steps in front of me with loose sand and some green vegetation. There's a mild breeze and the air smells clean. I walk down the steps and turn to my left where my energy conversion box is resting in the landscape behind a cliff overlooking the ocean.

The energy conversion box is very "cassette futurism" inspired; I like the theme. My energy conversion box has gone through many revisions, sort of on its own as I let the image develop however it wants. This theme, however, has been the same for about a month now. 

After tossing all the stuff that will distract me during the session into the energy conversion box, I too climb into it. This is the representation of my physical body, the ego. The "physical avatar" stays in here for rest and recovery while simultaneously allowing me to forget about it. 

After "I" climb into the energy conversion box, I visualize myself separating from my body as I step out. I don't climb out; this is my etheric body, and it has no boundaries as it passes through anything "physical" and otherwise. For whatever reason, I typically see my etheric double as composed of glowing green light. It's basically like a line drawing of my current physical self but luminous in green shimmering light. Once I'm out as my etheric double, I turn back toward the box and close the heavy lid and lock it. Finally, I press two buttons: one green for calm and peace, and one purple for healing and recovery. I can see green and purple light swirling underneath the closed lid as I turn away. 

I'm now facing the coastline and step up to the edge of the clearing on top of the cliff that juts over the water.

##### Letting The Quietness Of Spirit Come In

I begin to breathe deeply again. On inhale, I draw clean energy from the bottoms of my feet up to the crown of my head. On exhale, I purge spent and stale energy out of the bottoms of my feet. I do this three times. On the last round, I can feel new and clean energy built up at the crown of my head. On exhale, I direct this compressed energy to burst up, out, and around me. With the next inhale, I direct it to curve into me and pass through my heart chakra, which closes the energy loop. I'm now surrounded by a protective energy balloon which is a torus shape. 

When I exhale again, I can see a faint spherical outline of the energy balloon expand all around me; I see this in complete darkness behind my closed eyes. The first time this happened to me, I knew immediately it wasn't "just imagination." What I'll do then is spin this energy once left and another time right, both on exhale of my breath. Each time I do this, I see the outline shift into the direction that I intend. My eyes ***do not move***. 

I've been observing this behind my closed eyes for about 6 months now; this is the first time I'm writing about it. It doesn't matter if I have perfect prep or rush through it in the early morning before going on a run or lifting weights. It always happens. 

##### The Affirmation

Now, before I begin to move into focus levels, I recite my modified Gateway affirmation:

> I am more than my physical body. Because I am more than physical matter, I experience greater realities, energy systems, vibration, and knowledge. Therefore, I deeply desire to expand, experience, learn, understand, use, and control such energies and energy systems so that they may be of constructive benefit to me and to those who follow me. Also, I deeply desire the help, understanding, and cooperation of those individuals whose knowledge, wisdom, and experience are equal to or greater than that of my own. I ask of them guidance and protection from influences and sources that may offer less than my stated desires. "Spasi i sahrani". "Dum spiro spero". Thank you.

The affirmation is modified to kick things off in present tense, in the moment. Not "I am able to experience" but rather "I experience", *right now*. I've also added a few things to the main part. The "Spasi i sahrani" is a nod to my spiritual origin (Orthodox). "Dum spiro spero" is special to me and fortifies my resolve. "Thank you" is directed at my higher self as I concentrate energy of gratitude around my heart chakra and release it with a sharp exhale. 

The last "thank you" is another one I haven't written about, and upon making this expulsion of directed energy meant for my higher self, I typically see a fuzzy ball of plasma, mostly white but sometimes it changes color, move from the bottom of my field of view to the top as it ascends towards its destination. I see this every time.

#### Why Write About This Now?

I wanted to spend some time writing about my preparatory steps for this entry rather than focus on the actual meditation itself. I realize there are a few things I assume are known about this process, and I'm correcting that now. After all, my process is heavily based on the Gateway program, but it has changed and matured over time in my practice, so I wanted to make sure to record it.

By documenting this baseline process, I'm establishing a reference point for tracking further evolution. If these phenomena change, disappear, intensify, or develop new characteristics, I'll have this documented foundation to measure against. Early phenomena can be ambiguous—random neural noise, expectation effects, genuine perception—but six months of consistent observation across varying conditions provides sufficient data to distinguish signal from noise.

The spherical energy outline that responds to directional intention without corresponding eye movement represents a measurable marker. This decouples the phenomenon from visualization (which would typically involve subtle eye tracking) and suggests active perception of an actual energetic structure. 

The initiation protocol I've developed consistently produces these perceptible energetic phenomena, but the protocol itself isn't the cause. Rather, by methodically putting myself into focus levels (Gateway program) and under self-hypnosis, I transformed "hoping to perceive subtle energies" into "expecting them because they consistently manifest." The spherical outline and plasma gratitude response aren't imagination—they're reproducible perceptual events that occur regardless of preparation depth.

This realization reframed what I'd previously established as "agile awareness." That capacity emerged from something more fundamental: the ability to perceive subtle energy structures consistently, regardless of external conditions. The states I deliberately enter, combined with constant reaffirmation of what I'm seeking, signal to my subconscious: "Anton wants to see more of this part of reality." That sustained intention produced these results.

The methodology, the protocols, the steps ***you*** take are less important than what ***feels*** right for ***you*** and how long you stick to the practice. There are so many different approaches to consciousness exploration; pick one and grind it out for a few months, and then pick something else and see how that might work better (or worse). Keep doing this, iterate, adapt, and change. 

***Like most things worth pursuing in this life: time, effort, and consistency remain unmatched.***
