### The Broadcast Theory

**During one of my familiar, and at this point staple, stops in Focus 12 I inadvertently set off a cascade of events that helped bring into focus what I've been suspecting for quite a while. The first section is purely personal and subjective but it is important to observe before laying out the hypothesis. I will paraphrase before expanding on everything: What appeared initially as personal communications from *guides* have transmuted into a much more digestible and broadly defined communication modality.**

I was never really a big fan of constructing images of my *"team of guides"* all huddled together over my dumb human meat-space-suit acting very concerned and gently steering my existence with whimsical whispers and divine interventions. It's 100% egoic thinking. What makes me so special to have a *"team of guides"*? Nothing. These ascended beings have nothing better to do than to meddle in human business, and for what? To hoist their enormous cosmic egos to ever greater heights? 

Something else has to be going on here, or at the very least *prompting* us. 

#### The Setup 

It's Christmas afternoon and all the excitement (children) about stuff (children) has got me a little tired (it's always the children). I fired up the Expand App, timer section set to Focus 21, adjusted my mental timer for 30 minutes and just "let go and flow." 

Manifestation session went pretty good aside from some interruptions here and there in forms of foot and hand twitches. On my way back out I stopped in F12 and did my usual proclamation and offer for contact, *in any way*.

There was non-verbal communication (NVC) that appeared rather quickly which depicted someone drinking a green 1-liter bottle of clear liquid. Not quite sure what the message is but I'm going to start guessing these "live" so to speak. Since I don't know who/what sent it I'm going to default that "it was my guides maaan." Judging by the content of NVC, I need to hydrate. I just did, see guys, *I listen!* 

Said my thanks and quickly made full exit. 

#### Micro Lucid Dreams & Liminal

The intent that I set was to have an altered state experience such as a lucid dream or a projection followed by, "I want to connect with my guides." What followed after the meditation were 3 rapid-fire lucid dreams. None of them made sense and none of them were what I'd call "staging" for further exploration in projection/further altered states.

First one began in my brightly lit office like it often does, except the office in the waking life is never that bright. After the last quick lucid dream and transition to waking, another Liminal appeared in the subtle space between altered state and waking. This has been the hallmark for these mini-visions. 

I used to think that I was the primary reason for discovering these brief moments in the "in-between" by working very hard on concentrating in this space, pausing time, being extremely aware and intently focusing. Now I'm not so sure it was just me making this happen. Something in that space either noticed me or was there the entire time. Something has been attempting to catch my attention and succeeded while I'm genuinely interested from the start, not even thinking about "catching" anything "neat" or "cool" to look at. 

I know I'm curious but the messenger, or messengers, what about them? What's the purpose for these demonstrations? A couple weeks ago I began to slide back hard to viewing this phenomenon as being a result of communication from guides. The last Liminal that I recorded came after my intent to connect with "guides". I've been doing this for a while and initially when it all began this was my theory right from the start, I just needed to pay attention better and remember more efficiently. 

All of this has been progressing in a positive direction with me noticing my own awareness maintaining working memory from waking to an altered state, then to another altered state, and then back to waking. This hasn't been the case at all times but has become more evident that either the ability to maintain awareness across states has been developing on its own or the subconscious is assisting, perhaps both. All of this to say that I'm *somewhat* confident in stating that these Liminals are communications from guides. The modality is interesting and I still maintain that what I'm viewing is a "3D shadow" of a higher dimensional object/entity. 

Furthermore, I believe that these visions are likely occurring during neurochemical shifts as one state ends and another begins. Recent research has found that endogenous DMT—a compound naturally produced in the mammalian brain at levels comparable to other neurotransmitters like serotonin—shows measurable spikes in the visual cortex during extreme state transitions like cardiac arrest. While the popular notion that the pineal gland "floods" the brain with DMT during death or dreams lacks scientific support, there is evidence that DMT levels do increase during critical consciousness transitions, though as part of a broader neurochemical cascade rather than as a solo performer.

I've seen Liminals not just at the altered → waking transition but also altered → altered and waking → altered—basically any time there's an "in-between" subtle space to observe. The vivid, hyper, and energetic imagery aligns with what's reported in DMT experiences, which makes the correlation tempting. Whether these transitional moments involve actual DMT activity or simply share similar phenomenological signatures through other mechanisms, I can't say for certain. What matters is that something neurochemically distinct appears to be happening in these liminal spaces—a biochemical "between state" that may make consciousness more receptive to certain frequencies of information.

#### The Universal Translator

One more thing, and this is becoming a central point in how I observe and interpret these Liminals: the objects are *my* perception of the data that is being transmitted. In other words, communication is data, data is interpreted. One individual sends a "packet" of data to another, they share nothing in common but the information is still delivered (it's data). The sender uses their own symbolic language to compose the data. The recipient only has their own mental constructs, archetypes, etc. to draw from when interpreting, or perceiving, the data/information that is being sent. 

No wonder angels looked the way they did to those who encountered them. Some things seem to be common between cultures but the shape and overall appearance change. That makes sense—that is what those people "saw" because of their symbolic language at that time. Modern culture is going to have a radically different symbolic language based on the morals and technology that individuals grow up in. *That* shapes our perception and therefore vision of the "foreign" data packet being sent by *something*. 

We don't have direct decoding capacity for non-symbolic information at certain frequencies, so the psyche renders it through archetypal imagery we *can* process. This explains why different traditions describe similar phenomena with different symbolic vocabularies: Christian mysticism encounters angels, Buddhist practitioners experience jhanas, shamanic journeying reveals spirit guides. Same broadcasts, different cultural translation codebooks. The information is foreign enough that we can't immediately categorize it as technology, so we default to the nearest available framework—which for most of human history has been spiritual or religious.

#### The Broadcast

**The next question is:** Who and what is sending the message? Is it an actual NHI? Can't be a human construct or archetype, or maybe it can? Maybe that's just the name and understanding that we collectively gave to this specific function/contact entity that just exists in the non-local, and always has. 

I don't know what **exactly** the Liminals are but I get a *sense* that they are communications from guides. However, that is far too shallow of a conclusion to hang our hats on. I'm beginning to believe that ***these guides aren't personal to individuals but rather generic to everyone***. It's how we perceive them that changes their shape and presentation, but the gestalt is somehow intact throughout. 

Perhaps when our individual awareness becomes adept at picking up certain frequencies that's when we begin having these unique experiences. Maybe even that **something** gets our attention one day and we begin to focus on it, to be curious, to chase and look. 

Like a local news channel, these non-local entities—or information structures, or whatever they actually are—are always broadcasting and it is up to us to pick up the signal. **We're not special because we're "chosen." In fact, there's nothing special about receiving all of this to begin with because it is your choice to turn and look.** This flips the ego-centric view that interfacing with NHI (aliens, angels, demons, whatever) is on their terms and therefore the human receiving such communication is marked divine. Quite the opposite seems to be emerging: you are special because **you decided** to cast fear to the side and let curiosity drive your intention and actions.

Consciousness accesses information by tuning to specific frequencies. Different frequencies carry different data packages—some appear as guides, archetypal figures, symbolic imagery, direct knowing. Access mechanisms like meditation, altered states, or psychedelics widen the aperture to receive more of what's always been broadcasting. I wouldn't call it acquisition of new information—it feels more like remembering what was always accessible, just building the capacity to decode what's been transmitted all along.

#### Reframing Liminals

Now, about the Liminal that I saw the other day that got me thinking about all of this for several nights. It appeared as if it was on a head bust. At first it was geometric, round circles for eyes and mouth. Then, very rapidly, it began changing into different faces. They were speaking in unison, single message rather than each having their own. I could not hear anything but the emotion from the perceived data was that it was all the same message. 

This Liminal also marks another recurring type: shifting and changing visual planes. We can even throw glitchy behavior into this category. Viewed from the "broadcasting" lens that we just built, this spectacle is incredibly reminiscent of an antenna signal during bad weather or scrambled adult channels on cable television. Yea, I'm old enough to remember that. 

Given my contact protocol in F12, my original intent for these altered states and connecting with guides, early Liminal depicted the number "3" being written three times by an invisible hand... all seem to be pointing at angels, biblical archetypes, etc. and I mean, after all, weren't most of them what we'd call today as "guides"? Kim was quick to point out that my description sounds like a Cherubim.  

> What's a Cherubim? They are powerful, complex angelic beings from Abrahamic religions. They are often depicted with four faces (man, lion, ox, eagle), four wings, and bodies full of eyes, sometimes with legs like calves or brass, and sometimes alongside fiery wheels. Now here's my addition to the description: shape shifting, changing faces, always in motion, constant and endless transformation. Sounds confusing, maybe it's on purpose, or maybe our antennas need upgrading. 

The reason I—honestly it was mostly Kim—went straight to biblical depictions of angels and Western esotericism is because that's part of the culture that we grew up in. It makes sense that we would automatically pull from the most deep and entrenched archetypal imagery and concepts when confronted with data that we do not immediately understand, the data that is (perhaps) foreign to my being. 

I am talking about a "liminal" space, the subtle space, the "in-between," where I have found a way for the signal to reach me and focused in hard on the transmission (and always working on making it better). That doesn't mean that this is the only space for this communication to occur. Many people experience same or similar symbolic dialogue in many other states which include dreams, astral projection, and psychedelics. The signal didn't choose me or how I would come to find it—I did. Whether I knew how and where to find it doesn't matter. It was always my choice to act on subtle invitations and murmurings of the non-local and non-physical. 

***As I claimed earlier, I believe that the transmissions are continuous and are broadcast across the entire collective unconscious. When we decide to turn and listen is when we turn the unconscious into conscious.*** 

#### An Analogy

Imagine a busy morning in a heavily populated metropolitan area. Sea of people consumed with their own busy lives making their daily morning ritual of traveling to a destination only to return later the same day, or week. Sounds like modern slavery if you ask me, but perhaps we can pick at this thought another time. 

Every single one of those individuals is part of the whole and very unconscious sea of humanity. Now imagine a street musician posted up in their usual spot, elevated slightly on the platform edge or standing against a pillar. This position, standing above the flow of foot traffic while broadcasting their melody, serves as a metaphor of what Robert Monroe described during his own consciousness exploration: humanity at large exists in a noisy and chaotic frequency band while more coherent bands operate above that. 

> We're not claiming that the musician standing above the crowd is in any way superior in intellect to the commuters, but we are saying that their signal is more coherent above the crowd than the general noise at ground level. 

The musician plays the same melody, hour after hour, day after day. A continuous broadcast on a specific frequency. This is the critical piece: the music doesn't change based on who's listening or walking past. It simply is, transmitted into the space for anyone with ears to hear. Naturally most people just filter it out and continue on their way, letting the noise of their internal monologue and the chaos of the crowd drown out this signal which is elevated above the mass of people. 

Some folks don't tune it out, or can't, and their curiosity gets the better of them so they begin to listen. Those folks who stop in the middle of the morning migration aren't chosen—it is they who decide to not ignore the signal. 

Now here's where it gets interesting: each person who stops and actually listens to that music will experience it differently. One person hears melancholy, another hears hope, someone else connects it to a childhood memory. The musician is playing the exact same notes, broadcasting the same frequency, but each listener interprets the data through their own symbolic and emotional vocabulary. Not a single person will have the same internal experience of the music as another. Not even the musician themselves conceptualizes their own playing the same way their listeners do.

***This is what I mean when I say, "Consciousness exploration is slippery as all heck."***

This analogy was written to specifically describe the function of this "consciousness broadcast" rather than a 1:1 comparison. I do not believe continuously broadcasted transmissions, meant for anyone who takes notice and tunes in, are the artistic whims of intergalactic street performers. Though, at this point we can't rule anything out, I suppose.

#### In Conclusion

Let's drop the dreamy, yet very familiar, thought experiment and go back to our Liminal. Based on the rapidly changing appearance of the Liminal's face I believe it to be what a lot of people would call a Cherubim. No, I did not see 4 wings and lamb feet. I did see rapidly transforming, or turning, faces which is one of the hallmarks of the Cherubim. 

There's probably a good reason that I did not see the other features. It could be because while I am from a Western culture I also have had a lot of Eastern influence while growing up. What I mean to say is that the archetypes were loosely built, not as strong and solidified as someone who spent their childhood in only one specific culture. 

Maybe it's because I grew up in the modern and post-industrial version of these cultures. Maybe it's because I was part of the first generation to grow up using a computer and the internet without many memories of life without it. Surely that distorts and affects our deep and archetypal thought structures. 

Finally, it could be very simply that while I have noticed and have been putting effort into tuning into a specific space to receive the message, I still need more practice and time to further develop my transceiver, or "mental" ham radio, so to speak. 

Apply this same principle and perspective to UAP (formerly UFO) and paranormal experiencers. Now do the same for group-experiencers where you'll find some people seeing and experiencing different things, sometimes more or less, than others. Christian practitioners meet Jesus or angels, Hindu practitioners meet devas or avatars, modern secular practitioners meet "guides" or "higher self," and I meet shifting geometric faces that Kim identifies as Cherubim. Same frequencies, different cultural decoders interpreting the broadcast through available symbolic language.

Perplexing, right? I think collectively every person who's looking into the general realm of "consciousness" is a major contributor for the clarity that will come. 

***Thank you for sticking around until the end!***
