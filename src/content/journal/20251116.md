### November 10, 2025

#### 5 AM

* Woke up at 4 AM as usual.
* A week-off from physical training was coming up, so I was unsure if I should start it this week or the next.
* I sat up, got out of bed, reached down for either my running pants or pajamas. Came up with pajamas. Rest and recovery week begins.

#### Meditation

* 40 minutes.
* Went to my office for an early morning meditation instead.
* Laid down and worked on carving in the intention, "Now I am having a conscious out of body experience," one of William Buhlman's methods.
* After a successful meditation I rolled over for a quick snooze before getting up at 6:30 AM to get ready and head into my agency's office.

### November 11, 2025

#### Meditation

* 5 AM
* 30 minutes.
* Dick Sutphen, Chakra Balancing RX17.
* Instead of waiting until Wednesday, and since I am in my rest and recovery week from physical training, I decided this morning was a good time for chakra balancing.
* I know there is other material out there and I will end up trying it, but the way Sutphen walks you through this does two things. On its own it is effective, and the way he conducts the session teaches you to do it yourself.
* I like to do it on my own as well, especially when I am short on time.
* This track is also the most 80s thing you will meditate to, with subtle but very 80s sound effects.
* Nice session, felt light and calm.

#### Meditation

* 2 PM
* 40 minutes.
* Tom Campbell's binaural beats, 256-128-64.
* This was a modified Release Recharge session that combined The Gateway Program with Crystal Dreaming.
* I eased into Focus 10 using the usual sequence and shifted into the Crystal Dreaming framework once settled. I still have mixed feelings about rituals, but intent is the real mechanism and the structure helped more than expected.
* After invoking my opening intent I moved through Focus 12, reaffirmed sovereignty, and noticed my heart rate spike twice when inviting forward anything linked to the frail gray figure or stored anger. That physical reaction told me something was there before anything visual appeared.
* Eventually a pale phosphene form surfaced, flickering in and out as I questioned and acknowledged it. It felt foreign but familiar in the way old attachments sometimes do. I thanked it, released it, dissolved any ties, and reclaimed sovereignty before returning to Focus 10 and closing the session.
* A feature entry with the full breakdown is coming later this week.

### November 12, 2025

#### Meditation

* 5 AM
* 35 minutes.
* The Gateway Tapes, Wave VI, Odyssey, Intro Focus 21.
* Decided this morning was another good day to attempt F21. I have had problems with getting anything out of that level other than blind probing and then giving up.
* I usually speed through the prep for Gateway Tapes because the further you go in the program, the faster you are expected to complete all of it. I expected the same and rushed until reaching F12. Then I waited. I waited a long time. Note to self: I am already fast enough. No need to rush.
* Moving from F12 to F21 was interesting. I did notice energy shifts, subtle but present.
* Once in F21 the phosphene activity was calmer, mostly soft white or light movements. Different from my other experiences.
* I am pretty sure something tried to get my attention. I got a zap from something but had to move on and could not engage.
* I will need to repeat this with either the free-flow version or on my own, which I prefer more these days.
* Good meditation overall. Felt clean and efficient from start to finish.

#### Meditation

* Afternoon.
* 30 minutes.
* Tom Campbell's binaural beats, 256-128-64.
* A general meditation focused on non-verbal communication practice.
* Nothing of substance to report.

### November 13, 2025

#### Meditation

* 5 AM
* 40 minutes.
* William Buhlman, Count Down Globe method.
* I had forgotten what this one was like but as soon as it started it came back to me.
* I used to do this one on my own, and probably will again in the future. It is simple and works well unguided, especially with Tom Campbell's binaural beats.
* You complete your prep and reach F10. Then you deepen into F12 and beyond. The goal is to visualize an orb floating twelve inches above your head. The orb begins with the number 10 inside it, then periodically the number changes, counting down all the way to 1 as you move closer to your ideal state.
* It is basic. Once you do the guided version once you do not need it again unless you forget like I did. Either way, this works best unguided and with more than forty minutes.

#### Meditation

* Afternoon.
* 30 minutes.
* Tom Campbell's binaural beats, 256-128-64.
* I wanted to repeat Count Down Globe but unguided.
* After the prep I realized I would need more time for this one.
* I was also feeling tired, so I ended it at thirty minutes. It is always creepy how precise that timing ends up being.

### November 14, 2025

#### Meditation

* 5 AM
* 60 minutes.
* Expand App, Focus 21 timer.
* Returned to F21 without guidance to give myself more room to feel it out.
* Worked through prep with a few hiccups but settled in and made my way through the levels.
* Stayed in awareness at F21, not pushing anything since forcing never works here.
* A few dream-like sequences appeared, the strongest being a brief meetup with my step-sister.
* Ended the session tired and hungry.

#### Projection

* 6:15 AM.
* Reset intent before turning over: full out-of-body sequence, stable, lucid, open to learning.
* Took a while to fall asleep due to rapid-fire itches, but when it finally happened the transition was sharp. Strong vibrations from crown to root with automatic awareness kicking in.
* Dropped into a void, rode it out, and once the vibrations ended I found a warm light behind closed eyes that should not have been there.
* Caught a liminal right at the state change. It lined up with the transition but still surprised me.
* The scene opened into a vivid, physical-quality experience: driving with Kim and the dogs, hunger carrying over, pulling into a familiar-feeling house.
* A group of family members arrived, including my step-sister, matching the plan we made earlier in the F21 sequence.
* Inside, the atmosphere shifted. Familiar decor, children running around, adults gathering, a yoga class being set up.
* My step-sister and I talked. There was heaviness between us, and when we hugged it felt like something old finally integrated.
* I explored upstairs and took in details that slowed me down because everything looked and behaved exactly like waking reality, down to footprints on the stairs.
* I was pulled back abruptly and found myself on the day bed.
* A feature entry with the full experience and analysis is coming later this week.

### November 15, 2025

* Nothing much to report.
* I planned a mushroom trip today but things did not line up, so I listened to my intuition and scrapped the launch. This week is full of content, more than most, so I took that as a sign I did enough and need to recharge before diving into more altered states.
* On that note, I have not had an AP since yesterday morning.
* Afternoon meditation was rough. Hard time staying alert and present. Spaced out during prep. It took three attempts to get into F10, with foot jerks and something tapping my head. Once I got into F12 there were more distractions and clicking out. Scrapped that and took a nap instead.
* I set my intention for an altered state before napping but, as expected, nothing came of it.
* This was a productive week overall, so if things fall apart at the end, I am not concerned.
* Tomorrow’s afternoon session will focus on healing and recovery.

<br>

### November 16, 2025

* 2 PM.
* 40 minutes.
* Expand App, Focus 21 timer.
* Settled into F12 after uneventful prep.
* As I moved toward F21, somewhere around F18, my midsection spasmed. Not super hard, but enough to knock me off track, so I restarted at F10. Strange sensation.
* Once in F21 I relaxed and observed for a while, letting myself adjust. I used to do this with F12 often when I was learning. This is good. I have never done this with F21 before because there was nothing to relax into until now.
* After a few visual sequences I proposed a question: "Is there anyone here who can help me understand myself?" Testing the waters. Immediately a single strobe of soft white light pulsed behind my eyes and expanded outward. I have several theories about this, but today it feels like an automatic response from my energy body visually sending the question throughout my awareness. It could also be that I reached my ideal state for projecting. I did start feeling low rolls of vibration around the neck and head.
* I was a bit tired, so after a minute I stated my gratitude and exited the session for a simple nap.
