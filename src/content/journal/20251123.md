### November 19, 2025

#### Meditation

* Afternoon.
* 30 minutes.
* Chakra balancing. Spaced out a little in the middle but finished strong.

### November 20, 2025

#### Meditation

* Afternoon.
* Expand App, timer section, Focus 21.
* 20 minutes.
* Working with F21 more and more, getting acclimated and finding myself looking forward to these sessions even if they aren't as long as I'd like them to be.
* Curious thing returned that used to happen in the past: leg jerks.
* I'm not talking about a little tap here or there, these are full on foot went into air kind of jerks. Strong, random, and startling is the best way to describe them.
* Maybe these aren't as random as I think since I did get them before when I struggled with F21. Now that I'm finding a better foothold in the focus level the leg jerks are still present.
* Am I lowering myself so deep that these body checks are stronger? Or maybe it's the contrast of being so deep in meditation while the leg jerk itself is the same as before, only far more noticeable because of my deeper state.
* I'd like them to stop, that's for sure.

#### Lucid Dream

* Afternoon.
* 10 minutes.
* This was a fast one.
* It unfolded exactly like my previous staging lucid dreams do.
* I found myself in my office, incredibly bright, all the lights at full blast.
* The moment I became conscious I knew right away what was happening. No hints or anything odd.
* I slowly rose and hovered, then started gliding toward the office window over the empty daybed.
* I hit the window and barely went through it, then was reset to the back of the office. Very similar to the erratic loop from before.
* I figured out that what I was experiencing was a staging area and that I needed to lay down on the daybed. If I had done that I would have made an exit into a projection, but time was not on my side since I needed to get back to paying bills.
* The takeaway is that the time between setting the intent and having an experience is getting shorter and shorter when it actually executes.

#### Nap

* Just took a nap.
* No meditation, no projection, no lucid dreaming.
* I still set a quick intent for an altered state experience, but since I had already resigned myself to a nap that is exactly what I got.
* There's no fooling your subconscious.

### November 22, 2025

#### Meditation

* Afternoon, 45 minutes.
* Expand App, Focus 21.
* Stronger intent set before the session.
* Moved through prep quickly and rose through F10, F12, F18, then into F21.
* Brief sensation of being tapped on the right side of the head while settling in.
* Stayed mostly observational in F21.
* Dropped to F15 for a focused manifestation session, then to F12 to send a general greeting to any benevolent presence.
* Continued to F10 for health-focused affirmations.
* Ended the session with intent for an altered experience before sleep.

#### Lucid Dream #1

* Short lucid dream triggered by intent.
* Stabilized briefly but fell apart due to a physical itch.
* Yes, I levitated and flew around while I had the chance.

#### Lucid Dream #2

* Became aware mid-dream and transitioned into lucidity.
* Observed a scene with two individuals in a calm disagreement.
* The phone one person was holding levitated.
* The younger figure at the table noticed my awareness before the dream ended.
* Possibly a response to my earlier outreach before sleep.

### November 23, 2025

#### Meditation

* Afternoon.
* 60 minutes.
* Expand App, timer section, Focus 21.
* Essentially the same meditation as the day before.
* Continuing to get used to the F21 frequency.
* Worked on manifesting in F15.
* Once again initiated contact with any individual aligned with unconditional love and benevolence. Also mentioned that I'm writing and making an abstract illustration from yesterday's contact. I doubt broadcasting that matters but maybe something will come of it.
* Affirmations on my physical condition in F10.

#### Nap

* No altered states today aside from the meditation.
* While falling asleep I hit the transitional in-between and observed a liminal: small shapes swirling and turning clockwise, then forming a portal made of the same shapes continuing the same motion, now more like a wormhole.
* Nothing came from that so it's safe to say that witnessing a liminal simply means you're getting good at hitting that threshold space and holding awareness in it. An experience is not a given just because a liminal appears.
