### Agile Awareness

**With Focus 21, "the bridge to other energy systems" (or "when you go hella deep yo") opening up more for me recently my own focus has been on getting more comfortable with it. The first sense that is always "on" for me when I approach new focus states is feeling and emotion. Then, slowly, over time and with patience the other senses open up as well. Another skill or function has been developing alongside all of this, in fact it has been evolving from the very beginning, my awareness.**

It is not really even the senses that come online but rather the training of your receiver, your mind, to lock in on a frequency and then make sense of the data. Making sense of the data is what takes a while to unfold, and in my experience this is good design because the main function, as far as I can tell, is to help you acclimate to new non-local experiences. At the center of it all is awareness, the lens through which you receive new data. An evolving awareness is like a flower opening, letting in more light and expanding its aperture.

##### Meditation

It is a Saturday afternoon and I have 2 hours to meditate and jump into an altered state such as a lucid dream or a projection. I fire up the Expand App, navigate to the timer section, and put on Focus 21 for 1 hour. I mentally prepare for 45 minutes. The extra time is just in case I click out, which means suddenly losing awareness and time. Experience has shown me that if you say "alright, this is a 45 minute meditation" you will end it at exactly that 45 minute mark or something suspiciously close to it.

I spent more time getting situated before the session begins, in part because sometimes it takes longer to calm the mind down, and the other part is me experimenting with intent setting. I am also slowing down a bit and taking my time getting through prep. There are no guided sections ahead so I do not need to rush to get to my marks. I got into Focus 10 very fast, no body scan required this time. Expanded into Focus 12 quickly as well. I was ready to go today.

Moving forward I methodically climbed up to Focus 18 and visualized the bright light of Focus 21 in the distance as I counted up to it. When I arrived in Focus 21 I sat back and let things settle. During that time I felt someone tap the right side of my head. I immediately responded with "Who's there?" I did not get much in return. Maybe someone was checking if there was anyone there.

After a while I remember my awareness snapping in and out of focus a few times, and mentally saying "Alright, I think I've had enough." I gave my gratitude and dropped back down to Focus 15. While in Focus 15 I settled into a deep manifestation session. I like these now and again because it is the most focused I can possibly get for manifestation and practice of non-verbal communication (NVC).

As I made my exit I was still with it, so I did what I sometimes do while passing through Focus 12. I reached out to any individuals aligned with unconditional love and benevolence to say "Hello", in any way. This part is important.

I concluded by moving inward to Focus 10 and spent a good amount of time focusing on physical affirmation surrounding good health, strength, resilience, immunity, and finishing with a foundational present tense statement, "I am healthy."

##### Lucid Dream #1

The first lucid dream from intent before falling asleep was nothing unusual to report. It was the same as other quick lucid dreams that I have frequently. I think this one was a staging lucid dream but it began to break down faster than I could act on initiating a projection. When I woke up I realized why. I had to itch my neck badly.

##### Lucid Dream #2

The second lucid dream was a little different than usual. I was in a dream, no doubt about it. Suddenly, as I observed the dream through first-person and not me, I looked down at my hands. Turning them over once or twice, I quickly realized that I was dreaming. In that same instant my awareness snapped to third-person view. I was now intently observing. I was aware. I was present. I was here and in the now.

To my left, formerly right in front of me, sat a being who appeared relatively unthreatening in form, stature, and musculature. They, and I cannot quite pinpoint the gender, wore a size-too-big light-grey hoodie. Their arms were on the table, folded horizontally with both elbows on the tabletop. The table itself was dark grey or light brown. It is an odd hue that I remember experiencing somewhere. Their half-raised head was sometimes resting on their folded arms or nearly hunched, always at a slight angle as if cocked to the side.

The skin was white, not pale or sickly but simply very white, though otherwise healthy. If you saw this being pass you on the street you would not look twice. They were bald but young. Not bald and young in a hospital-commercial sense, more like someone who lives at a monastery or temple. They had light dirty-blonde eyebrows that were expressive and gave away most of their emotional state as they interacted with another individual in the room. Otherwise, their facial features were unremarkable besides the eyes.

The eyes were not enormous but they were big. So, big eyes, expressive eyebrows, thin lips and nose, small chin, bald, and white but not in a sun-starved way. The color of the eyes was grey or something close to it, hard to tell, a pretty dark shade overall.

Their presence felt intelligent and also fairly young. They were not threatening but they were completely in control. They could not hide that they knew they were in control. My presumption is that I perceived this because of their age.

The other person in the room was likely in their mid-60s. Strong, non-specific white skin tone, facial hair, also bald, with age lines and wrinkles mostly tied to laughing and smiling. I can usually tell with reasonable accuracy how an interaction will unfold with an older individual by analyzing their face. His tone was neutral. His movements were calm. Clothes were simple, light-blue jeans and a light-grey t-shirt.

The discussion was a disagreement of sorts but not intense. Serious enough, maybe about something this person could or could not do. Maybe the older gentleman was questioning them or coaching them. He held a phone and showed them something on it, then walked away to another part of the room to check on something else. While his head was turned, the phone levitated out of his hand so smoothly he did not even notice or re-adjust how his hands still held the phantom phone.

As I panned my awareness back from the phone to the young and slightly strange being at the table, they smiled and winked at me. The dream abruptly ended.

#### Debrief

Over time and due to circumstance I have been putting most of my energy into the following baseline protocol for these kinds of sessions:

`deep meditation → immediate sleep attempt → one-hour window`

This allows me to use deep focus states to prime consciousness, then catch the hypnagogic transition while I am still warmed up. I am not sure if my subconscious is learning the pattern or if I am becoming more accessible, perhaps both.

What this highlights more than anything is the agility of awareness. Hundreds of hours in focus states, systematic progression through the Gateway Program, deliberate intent-setting, all of it has widened the awareness aperture. I do not see this as any different than training for a marathon or any highly physical activity that requires peak performance.

##### Lucid Dream #2

I believe the disagreement I observed was about whether the young being could levitate the phone. They were clearly playing with the human observer in the scene. I believe this was a direct answer to my contact invitation in Focus 12.

The takeaway that led me to this assumption:

* Demonstration for my benefit: they levitated the phone while the human observer was not looking.
* Playfulness with power: showing capability in a controlled way.
* The wink: confirmation that I was the intended audience for the demonstration.

The older gentleman could have been a simple prompt or the interaction was layered. Real for him, performative for me.

I became lucid and aware in the dream through some sort of trigger, perhaps pre-planned. My awareness snapped from first-person view as the old man to third-person observer when I became lucid. The strange androgynous being directly interacted with my awareness as I observed the scene. The wink is the confirmation.

The structure of events is too tight and deliberate. None of this interaction feels familiar, and even if it was, that gets complicated very quickly. Which leads to the next question. Why choose a dream for contact?

I left the channel open. I provided no guidelines for contact conduct. Dreams are one of the most reported kinds of contact for a reason. Consciousness is in its most malleable, agreeable, and stable position.

Dreaming consciousness is already non-physical. It is flexible about what is possible. It is less likely to panic and collapse the interaction. It naturally operates in symbolic and visual modes of communication. By leaving the invitation open in any way, I removed obstacles and let them choose the optimal method. It is the safest situation for both parties.

Consider where consciousness resides and operates from. It is not here in the room with us but *it is also here in the room with us*. You cannot measure it, you cannot get behind it, and you are left with physical reality as the result of consciousness. From this perspective you are not having a connection in a dream or an altered state. You are having first-person contact that takes place in non-local and non-physical spaces.

When this event happens you are not going anywhere, and neither is the contacting individual. You are dropping filtering mechanisms that normally keep you locked into physical density consensus reality. No one is visiting anyone. It is you who becomes accessible.

Keep this in mind when recalling those wild dreams. Maybe sleep on it?
