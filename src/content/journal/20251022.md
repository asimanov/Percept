### What is the frequency of my field?

**This past week's theme included a side quest into practical and repeated interactions with consciousness. I often hear "Raise your vibrations" and just as often think, "from where though?" This got me wondering, is there a way to get some kind of an indicator on your "vibrations"? In The Gateway Program, you're taught how to create an "energy balloon" (toroidal field) around yourself for various needs, and it too responds to what your "vibrations" are. So I came up with a query to propose while in a deep but very busy state, F12, or "expanded awareness."**

**The query: *"What is the frequency of my field?"***

I repeated this question about four or five times during various sessions throughout the week where I could "drop in" (or "drop out," depending on perspective) for at least 30 minutes. I worked particularly hard to stay as neutral as possible, simply logging the output and analyzing it all at once later. It was difficult to keep myself from speculating too much since patterns are so irresistible. Here is the second-to-last day of repeating the question and my thoughts on the matter.

#### October 17, 2025 – Freeflow Meditation

Before I jumped into Tom Campbell's binaural beats for my purpose, I spent about half an hour checking out William Buhlman's "The Vortex" method. I really enjoyed it and definitely plan to practice with that one again. After all that, I fired up Campbell's "256-128" track and committed to about 30 minutes.

Jumping straight into F10 (mind awake, body asleep) was quick and uneventful. I then moved to F12 (expanded awareness) quickly as well. Unlike my usual F10 experience, this time, once in F12, the phosphene activity subsided as I felt myself expand well beyond my physical presence. The sensation is hard to describe, but essentially it’s as if your physical body had thousands of points outlining its shape that gradually lift off around you in unison. Another way to explain it is that it feels like you gain awareness of your subtle body, which expands beyond your physical body map.

Once settled in F12, I began to charge up my question and then released it to all parts of my expanded awareness.

***"What is the frequency of my field?"***

For a few moments, everything was dark and motionless. I kept my mind quiet and only directed my awareness to observe. After some moments, waves of dark, yet luminous indigo and deep purple bands started to wash over my field of view. It was like watching gentle waves flow onto the shore and retreat, soothing and relaxing. I watched this unfold for a bit, got my data point for the day, and before moving on, gave thanks for the answer I received. I refocused my energy and began to move into F15 (a place without time) to do some much-needed manifesting.

At the tail end of the session, I gave my gratitude again and retreated out of F15, F12, and once in F10, made my exit with the count of "1." Moving between states, forward and back, will always be a fascinating experience to me. In reverse, I could sense leaving the deep black void of F15, felt the expansion of F12 return, then felt a contraction back into the "mind awake, body asleep" state of F10. Finally, after invoking the number "1," I was fully lucid and felt very refreshed.

##### Observation

After receiving several visuals over the week, which included orbs and waves, I've settled on the fact that the answer to my question would be repeated again and again in a visual format. With that, I've landed on my field's baseline being indigo or deep purple, which isn't exactly "vibrations" but does relate.

The physical frequency of indigo is roughly 670–750 THz, with a wavelength around 445–425 nm. The visible spectrum is ~430–770 THz (terahertz), or wavelengths ~700–390 nm. So, in purely physical terms, the orbs and waves were emitting visible indigo light and would resonate in that high-frequency range, very close to violet and on the threshold before ultraviolet.

This could be a clever way of saying, "your field is barely visible in physical terms," which makes sense. No one is walking around glowing colors, though that would be neat, distracting, and revealing. Metaphysical frequency would relate to the third eye, intuition, perception, non-physical vision, and the transition from mental focus to direct knowing. For now, my interpretation of "frequency of my field" is that it resonates with the frequency of inner vision and subtle perception.

#### Transitional Lucid Dream

Unrelated but worth writing about is a different kind of lucid dream I've been having lately when my primary goal is to use it as an *entrance for projecting*. I spent a few moments reaffirming my intention to have a lucid dream followed by a projection. Then I spent more time attempting to actually fall asleep. If sleep doesn't come quickly, I begin to practice some sort of visualization, which eventually works fine. I don’t spend energy focusing or staying engaged when I begin to slip, I accept it and let it happen. The only problem with this is that instead of a ***blackout → conscious in a lucid dream***, the experience is more like ***visualize for what feels like forever → conscious in a dream long after it started***.

This one ended up more like a dream in which I became lucid. These tend to fall apart quickly once awareness is involved. The dream itself had a hyper-real lucid quality with a veil of dreamy haze over it once I became aware of what was going on.

For this reason, I call these "transitional lucid dreams." This altered state does not retain the same fidelity you'd expect from waking life or the stability found in solid lucid dreams or projections. Once you become aware in such states, that "dreamy" aspect speeds up the exit process because this altered state was never meant to be operated in for any particular purpose. It is only a gateway to the desired experience.

I had enough awareness to remember my original intention as the state began to break down. In that moment, I directed my focus to project and audibly said, "Project inward, I am going inward." After uttering that sentence, I was enveloped in darkness and began descending into a black void, something I've done many times before, so I was comfortable.

I began to subtly vibrate, like an engine waking up. As I focused on the sensation, accepting it and inviting it to intensify, I think I may have hit the bottom of my battery and lost it. All good. Overall, this was a successful progression of altered states, and I’m happy with the outcome.

#### Liminal

I don't expect these things to happen, but I do get a sense that they will anyway when altered states wind down and I’m on that threshold between what just happened and waking consciousness. Sure enough, a liminal appeared, this time in the bottom-right portion of my field of view. Typically, they are almost always against a very dark background, almost black, but with some difference in tone and temperature. Essentially, it’s similar to what you'd expect to see when you close your eyes.

For the life of me, I could not figure out what the object was this time, but it was new. From what I could make out in the short period of time that it performed and shrunk out of sight: it had a top and a bottom joined by a thin segment; the top part had four blocky sections joined together by more thin segments; the bottom part was heftier but may have been the same or similar four blocky sections. The entire object was mostly dark, which made it difficult to view against the black background. The blocky sections on top had neon mint-green "filaments," which immediately made me think of tritium vials.

#### Numbers

After everything was done and I was ready to get back to my day, I had the compulsion to check my watch. It read "3:33." In one of the entries from around the start of the year, I described one of my first encounters with liminals, which came in the form of "3" written three times, or "333," by an invisible hand.

When synchronicities like this happen, I interpret them as reassuring signs that I’m on the right track, to something. Or maybe it doesn’t even matter where I’m going.
