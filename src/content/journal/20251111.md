### Clearing the Field

**It's 4 AM, I feel alert and awake, it is my usual weekday time to rise and shine after all. Because it's my rest and recovery week from physical activity, my usually aggressive and fast-paced bursts of energy have now been replaced with calm and peaceful morning meditations. This morning I had a wonderful chakra balancing session which left me feeling light and energized. In the afternoon I settled down and got started on a session that has been long in the making. It's not the last time that I will be engaged in this type of session, since the first pass through made it clear that this was an instant staple.**

#### Part I: October 11, 2025

At 2 PM I settled in and started Tom Campbell's binaural beats, 256-128-64, for a 40 minute session. This was a special one involving a modified Release Recharge practice that combined The Gateway Program with Crystal Dreaming. The focus levels and states of Crystal Dreaming are compatible. What you focus on, draw on, interact with, and then remove, release, or integrate is basically the same between the two, with language being the big difference.

I put together my own version since I am comfortable with Gateway Tapes prep and entry into the focus levels that I need. From that point on I used Crystal Dreaming terminology and process. I am not super keen about it right from the start because it feels rather ritualistic compared to other systems or no system at all. I am not big on rituals in general. There was a guy who walked the Earth 2,000 years ago who talked about there being no need for them, and that always resonated with me even as a kid.

Having said that, sometimes rituals are important to gain understanding. I get the overall purpose but I continue to instinctively fortify my mind from such things. What I have found to be of much more importance is intent. A ritual is a way to fast-track intent-setting, but the biggest obstacle in these situations becomes you. What if you did not do the ritual exactly as instructed or exactly how you were trained? Is the whole session now a loss? It leads to needless obsession and automatic recital, which ironically robs the power of proper intent execution.

Regardless, I was told for a long time to give Crystal Dreaming an honest go and at the very least learn about it. That is exactly what I did, and I quickly found patterns and noticed how easily it fits with other serious practices.

I opened awake and aware, repeating this intent a few times before beginning:

> I choose, of my own free will, to understand and lovingly release any being or aspect connected to the frail gray figure and to stored anger. Only energies aligned with unconditional love and my highest good may participate.

It is important to note that I was extremely calm and relaxed already, in a very neutral and passive state of mind. I laid down on my office daybed designated for meditation and altered states and went into my prep: energy conversion box, resonant energy balloon, and the invocation of Focus 10. On my way to deeper states of F10 I alternated repeating: **body softer** on exhale and **awareness brighter** on inhale; **I release anything that is not mine to carry** on exhale and **I align my field with the frequency of love** on inhale.

Once I was settled, I noticed that phosphene action was dull or not present at all. The lack of phosphenes early on likely indicates strong stabilization. I was not drifting or daydreaming. I was steadying awareness before expansion. When phosphenes did arise later, they were subtle responses to energetic interaction rather than random visual noise.

I moved to Focus 12, announcing **I am present, clear, and sovereign in this field** once I felt myself expand into the field around me. The disclosure statement, as I like to call it, came next:

> As the universe is my witness, I am a sovereign being of light. Nothing has power over me without my free-will consent. This is a free-will zone; only unconditional love may come close.

In the middle of saying that, my heart began to speed up. By the time I was done it was racing a bit and my breathing was tense and short. I took note of that. That spike in heartbeat and shallow breathing was likely due to somatic resonance with the target energy. In trauma or shadow clearing, the autonomic system often protests before release. The body reacted as if a long-standing energetic contract was being challenged.

I let everything settle, scanned myself for tension or any related sensations, and then invited energy in:

> I call forward any aspect or being linked to the frail gray figure or stored anger. Step forward now so I may understand and release you in love.

At the end of that last sentence my heartbeat picked up again, with shallower and faster breathing. Noted again. After the invitation I disengaged and let observation take over. I waited for a bit while monitoring my nervous system, which was still acting unusual.

By this point I had some more typical phosphene action, but then I saw this light and pale, somewhat large blob that did not behave like the rest. It would grow quickly and then fade out of view as it flickered weakly.

I said, **I see you. You are safe.**

The main reason I connected all of that was because of how my nervous system was behaving. Usually I am extremely calm and not feeling the physical body at all. Every time I asked a question like **Who are you?** or **When did you first connect?** I would get the same weak glow and flicker-out response. After a while of this, I moved ahead.

The way I analyzed this behavior was that it aligned with a departing energy form rather than an integrated aspect. Flicker-fade behavior mirrors a connection dissolving, at least that is the impression I got. It felt reactive, long-attached, but foreign. A couple hours after this session I began to feel like the energy I was dealing with was artificial or placed, something like a software add-on or small application. It had a purpose but did not know me intimately.

I validated it: **Thank you for carrying what I could not.**

Before I started this session I thought I would find an aspect of me to integrate, but up to this point that was not what I felt. It felt foreign but clearly had been with me for a long time.

I released it:

> Thank you for your service. Our agreement is complete. You are free to go to the light in peace and love. Guides who love this one, please assist its return home.

Before moving out of Focus 12 I dissolved agreements:

> Across all time and space, I dissolve all contracts tied to fear, anger, or self-hatred. Thank you for the lessons. You no longer have my permission to remain.

I visualized light washing over me with the statement **All anger not needed drains away; only clean power remains.** Finally I reclaimed sovereignty: **I am a free, sovereign being of light. My field is my own.**

I moved out of Focus 12 and into Focus 10, stated my **now, I am out of body** intention as I always do, invoked 1, opened my eyes, rolled over, and took a short nap. No projection, which was fine.

#### Debrief

Not projecting afterward was beneficial. After an energetic off-load I needed to recoup and recover. If I had forced a projection here it would have been unstable and unpleasant.

When I invoked the phrases it felt like they emanated from the heart area, chakra. It felt like thin streams of energy extending from within and moving outward. My intent generator shifted from verbal to vibrational output, literally speaking from the heart. I was not reciting anything, the process was internalized. The intent aligned emotionally and cognitively which led to heart-field coherence and expansion.

I have a feeling I will be doing this type of session periodically. There is no way someone lives nearly 40 years with only a couple tag-alongs, unless you were raised in a temple. At first I was not sure I would be able to recite those phrases well, but before laying down I told myself that I would know what to do and say when it happened. And it did.

Running this session periodically is less about clearing stray attachments and more about maintaining resonance. I am not surprised it took me this long to integrate Crystal Dreaming into my practice. I tend to be paced and measured about learning and applying methodologies. Having said that, just like I admitted in the past, I was inadvertently looking for this type of session but did not realize it until now.

Part 2 ahead. It was a pleasant surprise indeed.
