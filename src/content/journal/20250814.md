### *Stars and Galaxy*

**I did a 30 minute Astral Projection hypnosis session by Dick Sutphen. I could kind of tell right from the start it wouldn't really work since I was rather tired. By the time I relaxed completely and sank further down to the edge of sleep I was clicking out pretty heavily. Eventually I found myself just zoning out in a black void, not even trying to project. I did have "closed-eye-vision" which has been coming through lately during these sessions. I ended the exercise early, came to my physical senses, put away my headphones and mask, turned over and closed my eyes for a few minutes.**

#### *A Conscious Out Of Body Experience*

I sometimes struggle to get a good nap going so I repeated a "deeper, deeper, deeper, down, down, down" countdown from 7 to 1. Ultimately what I did was visualize and create a whole scene of me performing the hypnosis on someone else, following the exact protocol that DS uses. I became conscious in a lucid dream that was in a familiar but also foreign place. It was a loose LD and while I navigated it just fine I decided to lay down and take a nap, pretty ironic if you ask me.

As I did that, I instantly blacked out and then became conscious again feeling intense vibrations race up from the root chakra all the way up to the crown chakra. The vibrations got stronger and stronger, rhythmic at first, frequency and pitch climbing higher and higher, I heard a crack and loud bangs and booms from electrical charges. I knew what this was and relaxed into the sensation as insane as that might sound. Then I fell down through the bed and into a black void.

The chaotic situation subsided after about fifteen or thirty seconds. I felt as if I was a balloon gently flowing in the breeze after its string was cut from a post it was tied to. There was still a little bit of a general electrical hum all around me but it was peaceful and serene. I fell further into the void once more and started to shoot off, somewhere, like a rocket ship. The sensation is as real as it gets, I felt the rush of air or some kind of resistance, I *heard* energy moving through me and around me.

Suddenly, there was a sound of radio frequency being tuned, it was cutting in and out like someone was changing the station on a manual radio. A middle-aged man talking in Transatlantic/Mid-Atlantic/Continental accent:

> **And now, stars and galaxy!"** 📻

I would momentarily stop speeding off and then back further down at incredible speeds. I came to a brief and gentle glide, panning from right to left, and my vision cleared. I was in space, stars passing by softly like jewels on a rich and deep black canvas. Again I began rushing and speeding off to somewhere. Imagine being a passenger in a convertible roadster and closing your eyes, maybe even poke your head out a bit. You feel the power of the engine, you feel the speed at which you're traveling with all of your senses other than your eyes, this is what it felt like every time I would speed off again.

I kept going down and down at increasing velocity, I began to feel a slight panic because this felt so much greater than anything I've experienced before. Right in that moment I saw a familiar gold orb jet into my view from my right side and pulse brilliantly in front of me, each time it grew larger and larger. Unlike in previous and calm meditations where the orb grows out of nothing and gently pulses in and out of the darkness, this time it was hauling ass and keeping up with me. As soon as I saw it I became elated and generally more confident. It was as if it showed up in a hurry with a:

> **Hoo boy! Here you are! It's happening!"** 🌟

And definitely:

> **Finally! You’re *awake*!”** 🌟

It felt like seeing an old friend in a crowd while in an unfamiliar place, both recognizing one another and instantly feeling grounded and self-assured.

After some time and racing around in the non-local I felt a very annoying sensation. My eyes kept trying to pry open for some reason. In hopes of alleviating the discomfort I let them open just a bit and through blurry and squinting physical vision I saw my office, I was facing the same direction that I laid down in to begin with. Through seeing the office I was still experiencing the OBE state but it began to fizzle out, I blacked out again and came to consciousness as I rushed back to complete physical integration and a slightly groggy state.

Holy crap! It's as if my subconscious took my original intent and filed a support ticket for it with the source. Then it got the green light from the department of consciousness awareness, reenacted the intent, and launched me into a projection taking my **very** conscious state for a ride along. Absolutely wild!

#### *An Analogy*

I've realized that there's been a number of events and past experiences that have had a lot of overlap with what I'm doing now. In a way each one of those events prepared me for the next one to come. Perhaps this insight explains why each new experience feels like an act of remembering rather than learning. I was pondering this very thought in the evening and the best analogy that I can come up for this process is by looking at childhood experiences that we can draw from if we were confronted with same or similar situations many years later.

For example, as a kid I did a lot of typical kid stuff which makes me completely not unique in any of this so without a doubt I know that you can relate. One of those things was jumping off cliffs and boulders into a body of water. Great fun! However, initially for me it was a great fear. Once I broke through that fear and had the experience of jumping from a high point in space, a boulder on a side of a river, into a lower point in space, the river, I instantly integrated it and no longer feared that particular situation. Heck, I remember learning how to gauge depth of water by how opaque the color of the river appeared in different areas... and then aim for those areas. Sometimes those areas were very narrow.

At that time in space (heh) I felt like I had an appropriate ratio of curiosity to fear. I was perfectly flexible in my thinking and decision making, I was more accepting of change and would seek new experiences daily. I was a normal child growing up in a relatively normal point and time in human history. So how does that relate to OBEs? Simply put, if I was placed in a situation where I had to physically leap from one high point in space to another low point in space I can rely on a very robust memory to draw from and therefore my initial fear of the event will be subdued. All of my senses will make sense, and in the moment I will be living a new experience while simultaneously re-living all of those old experiences. Pretty neat!

> Okay, but you still haven't answered the question... how does that relate to OBEs?"

At first an OBE feels new and overwhelming, more often than not it invokes a fear response. Then the initial fear subsides. After the experience you simultaneously think about it as new and feel like you are remembering. You've done it before, this is a "knowing" and not analysis. In fact you've done it before so many times it's not even efficient or useful to truly remember each and every one of them. So, when that "sleep paralysis" strikes or you find yourself suddenly overcome with every cell and molecule in your body alarmingly and powerfully vibrating right when you hit that wonderful human trance during a meditation... it's ok, relax, you've done this before.

I can't help but feel grateful and at the same time be amazed that I get to witness, remember, and be part of this strange and beautiful existence.

#### *Lessons*

1. ***Sound*** - I never appreciated this as much as I did during a conscious OBE. *To me and my experiences* sound is far more intense and real than visuals. If I had to rank my senses in terms of importance during these exercises: sound, all other senses, vision. Once I started to pull on all other sensations other than visualization I gained a better understanding of the "ideal state". This is not to say that I have absolutely zero vision in those moments, I do, it's just that all other senses are more conducive for an actual and conscious separation.
2. Guides, aspects, subconscious, whatever - ***you are never truly alone.***
3. ***You are more than your physical body.***
