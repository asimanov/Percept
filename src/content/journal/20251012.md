### October 8, 2025

#### Meditation

* Meditation was enjoyable and calm.
* I initially went in with a lot of energy but felt pretty tired toward the end and had a hard time keeping focus.
* When I’d regained focus, I often forgot what I was doing or trying to accomplish.
* Felt low vibrations throughout the body and encouraged them, relaxed into them, but it wasn’t time yet and they disappeared soon after.

#### Lucid Dream

* Lucid dream began in my parents’ house.
* I was standing in the center of my room, instantly recognized what was what, and jumped into the air to begin flying as quickly as possible.
* Just like with OBE, the goal in lucid dreams is to get moving right away or they tend to end very quickly.
* I jumped into the air and started to take off toward the window with the intention of going through it.
* As soon as I got close and passed just beyond my head, I was looped back to the back of the room.
* Again and again, I shot toward the window and was “reset” to where I started each time.
* I’m stubborn, so I shifted my intent to fly faster and higher, hoping to break out, but that only made me glitch and loop repeatedly.
* How strange.
* I decided the struggle was over and just stood in the middle of the room as the “simulation” dissolved, taking me with it.
* Upon my exit, I had the familiar experience of seeing a wild object doing impossible things. These little show-stoppers now seem like 3D shadows of 4D objects, at least that’s the “feeling” I’ve been getting recently.
* The object was mostly iridescent and blue, shimmering and twisting, undulating with ribbons and disks.
* One of the ribbons pushed its way to the outer center, changing to orange and gold as it glowed and twisted inward.
* This time the object, in fantastical motion, began as a relatively large part of my field of view against a black void backdrop.
* As it twisted and moved, it shrank to my bottom right.
* I was able to “zoom in” and focus on it until it disappeared.
* I used to think I came to waking consciousness after this little demonstration, but I now strongly believe it bleeds into my already local physical state. I just wait and hold the performance as long as possible before removing my mask or opening my eyes.

### October 9, 2025

#### Meditation

* Tom Campbell’s binaural beats, 128–256.
* Did the general Gateway Tapes prep and dropped into F10 very quickly.
* Feeling pretty tired.
* Hit the ideal threshold faster than normal. Again, I’m tired, so I had a feeling where this was going.
* Had some initial strength in focus, but then found myself spacing out and letting the initial visualizations run on their own.
* Quit the session, removed headphones, took a cat nap.

#### Evening Walk

* Not exactly a normal entry, but saw something worth recording.
* Toward the end of my walk, as I turned down my street heading south, a bright green ball of light caught my eye to my upper left (southeast). As I glanced in its direction, it pulsed brighter and began to descend down and away from me. It had a long, wide, green, tapering tail as it disappeared. I believe it was at about helicopter altitude (as they operate over the city), which is lower than an airplane but not close enough to tell what it was.
* Could have been a firework.
* Could have been a flare.
* Could have been swamp gas fart.
* It’s spooky season after all. 👻

### October 11, 2025

#### Meditation

* William Buhlman OBE track, “Count Down Globe,” guided with binaural beats, 45 minutes.
* Did my typical prep (modified Gateway Tapes prep).
* Thought I’d give this one another try. I haven’t had much luck with it in the past but wanted to focus more on completely ignoring my physical body during practice sessions, so it was worth revisiting.
* Overall, I had about the same level of success as before. Not bad, but not something I’ll be rushing to do again.
* Experienced the familiar guidepost of expanding consciousness at the threshold again. The more rested I am, the more detail I detect in these moments, much like last week. This week I’ve been more tired than usual, and I’ve noticed almost everything in my practice feels a bit more dull and scaled back.
* Soon after the threshold sensation, I began my attempts.
* Heartbeat rising in the head area, all good but not helpful when trying to ignore the physical completely.
* Closed-eye vision, always confusing for me, but I’ve been marking it as a guidepost recently so it no longer distracts me.
* Slight vibration in the head and neck area, very weak this time.
* I “popped out” right above my physical but had extremely limited senses.
* “Clarity Now” and “Awareness Now” commands didn’t have much of an effect.
* Overall, this wasn’t bad and I’m always glad I did it, but I probably won’t be returning to this one soon.

#### Freeflow Meditation

* After turning off the Buhlman track, I removed my headphones but kept the blackout mask on.
* Lying on my back, I started another meditation focused on practicing visualization and exit techniques. Seems like this is what I’ve been doing in nearly every session lately.
* Funny, I basically did the “target method” by Buhlman for this one.
* Same as before but entered F10 and F12 much quicker, with the threshold transition sensation coming on fast.
* Overall, I had some light success but ultimately fell asleep as I kept losing interest and was too tired to maintain focus.
* Shortly after, I decided it was nap time.
* I set my intent on having a lucid dream or projection as I fell asleep but ended up just… sleeping.
* Not disappointed. I’m tired, boss.

### October 12, 2025

#### Self-Hypnosis

* 40-minute guided session.
* Went into this one with a “just observe” mindset and the intent to accept whatever happens, but midway through I started getting annoyed at the guided parts because I kept automatically drifting into doing my own thing.
* No threshold sensation but several sudden moments of awareness.
* These moments weren’t special; I was wavering in and out of light sleep, unable to maintain waking state as the body fell asleep, drifting in and out for most of the session.
* Traditionally, this situation is referred to as “clicking out.”
* It’s ok, not a total loss. Usually, I can gauge how it’ll go as I lay down, but I was off the mark this afternoon since I felt quite awake.
* At the end, though, I felt refreshed. Must have needed the rest after all.
