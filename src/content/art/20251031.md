description: 'The controls of the claw machine represent your intent interface. The claw itself is the subconscious, and the “prizes” are experiences and altered states. The admission is free. I put “prizes” in quotes because it may not always feel like a prize when you receive the experience. The claw is famously a pain to deal with. It feels like once you get used to one machine, it’ll reset or get worked on, and it’s back to being unpredictable and slippery.'
