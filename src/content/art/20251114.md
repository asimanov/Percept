description: 'My step-sister and I talked about how we were doing and what we were going to do next. There was a sadness hanging there while we spoke. I reached out and we hugged. I said, “Remember, you are my family too.” She replied, “I do, and you are too.” This felt like integration of something. The sadness lifted and the class was about to start.'

My initial “Clearing House” meditation ended up being only the first part of the chain of events that this image is dedicated to. A few days later I had a very steady unguided Focus 21 session which was followed by a projection that closed the loop.

At first I planned to illustrate an abstract interpretation of streams of filaments emanating from the heart area. During the research and exploration phase I kept circling the heart chakra sigil instead. Known as Anahata in Sanskrit, it is symbolized by a twelve-petaled lotus with a central hexagram formed by two intersecting triangles. The upward-pointing triangle represents Shiva (masculine energy and consciousness), while the downward-pointing triangle represents Shakti (feminine energy and creative power).

At the center of the symbol is the Sanskrit bija mantra “YAM” (यं), traditionally chanted to activate and purify the chakra’s energy and foster love, compassion, and emotional healing. The heart chakra is associated with the color green and governs qualities such as love, empathy, forgiveness, and harmony.
