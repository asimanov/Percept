description: 'He leans over and whispers something into the bear’s ear, then he mounts the brown beast like a horse. The bear and the rider take off through the snow-covered ground. It appears that I’m observing from a bird’s-eye view, like an eagle or owl flying above the dream’s subjects. It’s a crisp winter day; you can see their breath trailing even from my very high vantage point.'
