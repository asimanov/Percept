description: "Problem: Illustrate a subject from history (not fantasy) any time up until 1969. Include at least one male and one female figure in the illustration. The costume, uniform, or clothing of the figures should be accurate and distinctive of a time and place. Research and document your costume choices. Subject: Late 1930's, Zoot Suiters. Medium: Watercolor and brush & ink... some tech pen (my love) help, *shhh*. I know, I have problems up my nether regions with technique, buuuut, I enjoyed this, and will continue to hone my skills. :) Let me know what you think. :)"
