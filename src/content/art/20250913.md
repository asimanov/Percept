description: The white petals and yellow center resemble “day’s eye,” derived from its habit of opening during the day and closing at night. It is a powerful and living metaphor for renewal and new beginnings... Like a field of daisies opening its resilient and beautiful flowers at dawn, humanity too awakens once more. Free from the burdens of yesterday’s pandemonium, we take our place in the “Symphony of Hope” as we march toward a beautiful future.
