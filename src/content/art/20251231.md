description: 'Unpacking the toroidal structure(s) is worth exploring as it is both setting and focus of the illustration. Hermetically it is a self-sustaining energy loop, the mentalism principle; Platonically it is a form generating material expression of Christ consciousness, the “Kingdom within” as geometric reality; Practically it is my actual energy experience during meditation.'
