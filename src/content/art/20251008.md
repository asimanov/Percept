description: 'The object today was mostly iridescent and blue in color. It was shimmering and twisting, undulating, vibrating, with a mix of ribbons and disks. One of the ribbons shoved its way to the outer center and changed to orange and gold as it glowed and vibrated inward. This time the object, in fantastical motion, began at a relatively large portion of my field of view against a black void backdrop. As it twisted and moved it shrank to my bottom right.'
