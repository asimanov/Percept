description: "The assignment was to illustrate 3 signs of the Zodiac, keeping in mind particular culture or art movement. I went with illuminated manuscripts (such as Book of Kells). I didn't have time to tool out a bunch of celtic knots, so I basically focused on the signs themselves (it was hard to keep away from drawing a realistic human body), in the illuminated manuscript style. Not sure how I feel about it, I might re-visit this at a later time."
