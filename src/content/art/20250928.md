description: 'Even in the dark you can see the stoic appearance of these buildings. Kвартира (kvartira) just means “appartment”. The buildings themselves weren’t of the most high quality construction but that was also a feature. These types of apartment buildings were constructed out of prefabricated concrete panels or bricks en mass to accommodate the population with single-family homes during the Soviet Union.'
