**Now that you've indulged me in reading about my [pre-meditation base process](/journal/20251206), let's get on with the action.**

### January 6, 2025

##### Meditation - Focus 21 

The rest of the meditation went pretty well. After moving to Focus 10, mind awake/body asleep, I expanded into Focus 12. Once there I made my presence known:

>As the universe is my witness, I am a sovereign being of light. Nothing has power over me unless I grant my freewill consent. This is a freewill zone; only those aligned with unconditional love may approach.

After resting in F12 I tuned to Focus 15, then Focus 18, then I declared "I am approaching the bright white light of Focus 21" and moved toward it. Once tuned in to Focus 21 I made my presence known again and rested in my awareness, letting things come and go while maintaining focus. This is always the most challenging part. 

After a little while of being noticed and "prodded" by energies here and there I gave my thanks and began my exit. I turned my awareness to Focus 15 and had one of my most solid manifestation sessions: played out scenes of having already achieved what I was after with every sense I could employ and with every emotion/situation I could realistically put together. The goal is to get lost in the constructed reality of it but still maintain focus to have control over the situation and subsequently the exit. As Neville Goddard eloquently put it, "Living in the wish fulfilled."

Dialed in on F12 once more, proclaimed my presence, explained who I was the best that I could with NVC and invited individuals aligned with unconditional love and benevolence to make contact in any way. I waited but nothing came about. I was kind of hoping for another NVC transmission to illustrate but not today. When I say that I make it clear as to who I am while making this request, I describe that I record and illustrate my experiences from the nonlocal/nonphysical when I'm back in the physical. Don't want anyone to feel "hoodwinked," or rather, I want them to know immediately that I'm not withholding intent. 

Lastly, as I contracted back into F10, I made my usual affirmation for physical health, strength, and resilience. Before full exit I spent a few moments setting my intent for an altered state experience, directed at my subconscious and always spoken in present tense.      

##### Lucid Dream -> Projection/Partial Separation  

After the meditation session I put my headphones and eye mask away and rolled over. Falling asleep was not at all a problem today. 

I became lucid in my dream fairly quickly. Outside in my backyard, the temperature felt cold but nothing like it is right now (in physical reality). I guessed it was evening as the sky was dark, but it wasn't just dark, it was that kind of blue-black that you sometimes notice before a storm rolls through. That made me feel a little uneasy. This setting isn't new; it's a recurring staging ground I've learned to identify over the years and there's always a sense of foreboding hanging in the air. 

The part that escapes me is if I was alone or with someone else. I want to say there was *somebody* there but recalling the memory feels like someone went through and erased their detail but left the feeling of someone else's presence. My gaze kept returning to the center of the large patio concrete slab where sizeable gold pixels kept glitching in and out of existence. A gust of wind broke my fixation as I tilted my head up and to the left.  

The sky grew darker from blue-black to pitch black. I could see the trees begin to sway from the whipping wind. I turned toward my house and headed to the back patio door; it's time to get inside. The door was locked. Shit.

As I looked through the thin side windows on each side of the door I could see that the inside of the house was dark and that I could not feel anything in there. Ah! That's the clue. This is a staging lucid dream, I'm alone and it's about to be over so I better get to it.

Once I made this realization I felt vibrations race up and down my spine starting with a low rumble that began to build up to a steady hum. My body twirled in place as I felt myself sink into a vortex. There's a moment of brief blackout before my field of view began to flood with soft and warm light. Such a pleasant and calming transition.
 
I could feel that I was back in my physical body on my office daybed. I did not move; I'm in the zone and ready to project. Heck, I already am because I can feel myself out of the physical body already—just not very far. As I begin to move forward, which is actually down with how I was originally positioned, I didn't like that, so I changed my direction to the right and up. Yep, sure enough, my awareness switched and I began to move in the direction of my intent.

My face felt like it was stretching 6 feet in front of me. I've felt this same sensation before when I was a teen when I was extremely miserable with bird flu. So my face, torso, arms, all were stretching outward and up from my physical body's location, where I was directing it all to go. With that I felt static electricity buzz and pop all around me and I absolutely love this sensation! I think it could be frightening but something about being pure energy and directing my will outward like lightning is extremely exhilarating. Throughout this entire process there was a steady electrical hum in the air. Once again, I absolutely love it! This exhilarating sensation reminds me of some sort of starship engine warming up with so much potential to blast off into the void (which I have done; yes, it's the 'bee's knees'). 

Sadly, this time I think I got a little too enthusiastic about pushing my way forward and out. The top half of my physical body lifted up and over for a good while before I was sucked back in. 

Electricity gone, energetic hum gone, mission (partially) aborted but I am content.

I plug my nose and check if I can breathe; I can't, which means I'm "awake." Reality checks like this are best done right before and right after altered states in my opinion. It's a way to reinforce the distinction of states and modes of awareness you just experienced from physical waking life while also continually reporting back to your subconscious that this is, in fact, what you want to do. The subconscious understands symbolism and complex emotion far better than words; train this way as often as you can remember. 

I grab my phone and check the time. It's 3:33. I recall the day earlier in the year where an invisible hand drew the number 3 three times to me while I was in a liminal state—the "in-between," areas where altered and waking states meet. 

##### Debrief

My number one priority after this session was to figure out who or what had been in my lucid dream before being intentionally removed. I recalled an incident a couple of months ago where I heard myself ask me "Ok, where do you want to go?" when I projected into a wormhole. In that situation, while a little startling, I knew exactly who asked the question: ***me, my subconscious***. 

I've been working for about half a year to improve my communication with the subconscious, learning and understanding the kind of language that it generally prefers and my own signatures that aren't exactly readily revealed to me on that level. The subconscious is always listening, always processing, even if you don't directly prompt it. Once you turn your awareness toward it and begin to address it directly then the results too become more direct and delivered at a faster pace than passively living your life without acknowledging this amazing aspect of yourself. 

The real surprise for me has been when it decides to talk back. So, given this context I know who was erased from the lucid dream: ***me, my subconscious***. It's self-obscuring to maintain functional separation between conscious awareness and the scaffolding architecture. The subconscious preserves emotional presence while removing identifying details that might create cognitive dissonance or interfere with the transition mechanics.

What I love the most about this development is that the last six months of "prompting practice" has established enough rapport that my subconscious can surface as a distinct collaborative agent rather than remaining invisible infrastructure. Therefore these "staging" lucid dreams are not just threshold environments; they're active communication interfaces where the subconscious signals readiness for separation. 

* Blue-black sky + foreboding = transition window opening
* Locked door preventing house entry = physical body access intentionally blocked
* Erased companion presence = subconscious maintaining setup while signaling "we're ready"
* Environmental collapse = handoff from dream scaffolding to energetic projection

Another important aspect of analyzing these sessions is to build and achieve "the **discernment database**." It's difficult to make sense of interactions in subtle spaces to begin with; after some time and gathering data we can start to look at the patterns in front of us (like good humans that we are) and construct categories. 

* Consistent patterns = likely subconscious architecture
* Transition-window phenomena = potential Liminal contact
* Dream-space encounters with autonomous behavior = NHI contact
* Protocol-responsive phenomena = subconscious confirmation

That is my current and subjective discernment database. Do you have one?
