description: After seriously committing to my meditation practice, I gradually began experiencing spontaneous floods of purple across my visual field. Sometimes it's random spots; other times it emerges gently from the sides or directly from the front. On one memorable occasion, purple completely overtook my entire vision for a few momentsâ€”it felt as though I'd experienced a personal BSOD. Yet, in all seriousness, it was an exceptionally calm and pleasant sensation.
