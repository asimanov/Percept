description: Upon exiting, I kept my focus—this is usually when intriguing things occur. My orientation distinctly “shifted” back into my body lying on its side. My vision was filled with a black void centered around a pulsing white portal—a wormhole. I couldn’t discern if I was moving forward through it or seeing it recede, but it didn’t matter. This captivating experience lasted a while as mesmerizing waves of thick, expanding white circles pulsed from the center, washing over me.
