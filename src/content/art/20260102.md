description: 'I want to see these things, I want to learn, but I also must understand that these incredibly subjective experiences must be handled carefully and most of all to avoid over-attachment to any one thing. Of course it’s impossible to learn about yourself or others without entangling the ego. Ego is history, but the more we identify with that the less we are ourselves, less conscious and in control. The elephant knows, that’s why it’s laughing. Perhaps it was me who’s laughing, or is that over-attachment?'
