description: 'I took a deep breath in and exhaled while repeating, “I surrender.” My vision went black as I felt myself, my awareness, literally move inward with a “wooshing” sound. Soon after, I found myself inside of a tunnel. The end of the tunnel had small but bright and geometric (cubes, glitchy looking, almost like pixels but with depth) lights comprised of blue, white, green, and red. I may have seen orange as well.'
