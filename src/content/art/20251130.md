### Full context from meditation on 11/30/2025

> Almost immediately received a basic visual of a lava lamp snow globe. The overall scene was warm and pastel-like colors. The globe was of course a sphere. I call it a “snow globe” because I did see particles falling in it. I also remember seeing the basic landscape inside of it, made of geometric shapes, move and flow like you would see in a lava lamp. The lava lamp part stayed at the bottom, gently shifting and moving like it was alive. The globe itself had no discernible color. It was simply a clear crystal. The base of it is harder to recall but, once again, it was primarily of simple and geometric shape(s). My attention was supposed to be on the contents of the globe and clearly that worked. Whoever sent that, I wonder what the message is and I wonder how it relates to the current time in our physical world: Fall/Winter, December starting, Christmas, snow globe, etc.

> It was brief, but this kind of contact is usually like this. Brief non-verbal communication (NVC) right after initiating interaction, or asking for one. There’s hardly ever a follow-up, just a flash or a few second scene and then it’s over. It’s super harmless and safe for everyone.

### Nonverbal Communication (NVC)

One of the core concepts that is taught in the Gateway program by the Monroe Institute is nonverbal communication (NVC). 

Nonverbal Communication, as taught by Robert Monroe, refers to the instantaneous transfer of complete conceptual packages—termed "thought balls" or "rotes"—that occur in altered states of consciousness. Unlike language that transmutes ideas into sequential words, NVC transmits entire concepts holistically, complete with emotional context and multiple layers of meaning arriving simultaneously. 

The experience is described as direct knowing rather than hearing: information appears fully formed in consciousness, often continuing to "unpack" additional meaning over time. Monroe observed that NVC becomes accessible primarily in Focus states where ordinary sensory processing is reduced, and that it transcends cultural and linguistic barriers by operating at the level of pure concept rather than symbolic representation.

The challenge for practitioners lies not in receiving NVC but in translating these multidimensional rotes back into linear language for documentation. I have also found that "generating" NVC is challenging and takes a lot of practice and repetition. It is often misunderstood as an "easy" task for a creative individual, and I can attest that there isn't anything easy about NVC no matter how creative you are. 

I urge anyone who is interested in learning and using NVC in their own practice to attempt NVC as often as possible. Repetition and a steady practice cadence will get you much further than simply believing that you can rely on your already developed creative skills.
