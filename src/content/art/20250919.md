description: 'I took a small step back and felt the chain that is around my neck lift up and then tighten. I began to feel moderate pressure around my throat and resistance as I grasped for my chain, at the same time it felt like I was being pulled down into the office floor... To end the struggle quickly I used an old trick: envelope whatever is being aggressive with a brilliant white light of love.'
