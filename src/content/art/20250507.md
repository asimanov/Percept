description: 'During an experimental F18 meditation one evening, I encountered visuals more vivid and frequent than usualâ€”tunnels and portals with intricate movement, pulsing at the edges, and snaking patterns drifting toward the upper right of my view. These forms rarely appear to me with such intensity outside of F18. The colors stood out too: a dynamic blend of purples, pinks, golds, and the occasional vibrant green.'
