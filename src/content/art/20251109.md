description: 'Instead, I gently lifted into the air: the smoothest floating movement I’ve ever had. Then, with the same effortless control, I rose further and drifted toward the office window. The motion was calm and deliberate, the glide natural. I reached the window, shutters still closed, and remembered my intent: “Take me to the place where I learn about myself.” Wooshing sounds began, my vision dimmed, lights flickered through the white shutters.'
