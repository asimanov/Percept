### Anton Simanov

Anton Simanov is a gonzo endospiritual journalist, writer, and creator of Percept Index, an ongoing chronicle of his exploration into consciousness. What began as scattered notes from meditation sessions and lucid dreams has grown into a deliberate practice of documenting altered states of awareness, hypnosis experiments, and out-of-body attempts. His work reads less like detached research and more like raw, first-person reporting from the inner frontier, where everyday life intersects with moments beyond physical reality.

The project is less about reaching final answers and more about building a record, a map drawn in real time as he navigates the strange and slippery territory of consciousness. Each entry blends personal reflection with unfiltered detail, balancing discipline with curiosity, and grounding the ineffable in language others can follow. Alongside the writing, Anton creates art and illustration that expand the project into visual form, offering another way to approach and interpret what words alone cannot fully capture.

Professionally, Anton is a Senior Web Specialist and web developer with a background spanning communications, design, and technology. He holds Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) credentials, applying Agile principles to the systems and projects he leads. He runs long distances every week, lifts weights in the early mornings, and keeps a steady rhythm of self-experimentation both physical and mental.

Anton lives in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley with his wife and two young children, where family, work, art, and inner exploration are not separate pursuits but parts of the same experiment of being alive and aware.
