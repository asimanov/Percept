### Anton Simanov

Anton Simanov is the writer and creator of Percept Index, an ongoing chronicle of his exploration into consciousness. What began as scattered notes from meditation sessions and lucid dreams has grown into a deliberate practice of documenting altered states of awareness, hypnosis experiments, and out-of-body attempts. Through these writings, Anton searches for patterns, meaning, and the threads that connect everyday life to moments that feel like glimpses beyond physical reality.

His work is less about reaching final answers and more about building a record — a map drawn in real time as he navigates the strange territory of inner experience. Each entry blends personal reflection with honest detail, balancing discipline with curiosity, and grounding the ineffable in language others can follow. Alongside the writing, Anton creates art and illustration that expand the project into visual form, offering another way to approach and interpret what words alone cannot fully capture.

Professionally, Anton is a Senior Web Specialist and web developer with a background spanning communications, design, and technology. He holds Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) credentials, applying Agile principles to the systems and projects he leads. He runs long distances every week, lifts weights in the early mornings, and keeps a steady rhythm of self-experimentation both physical and mental.

Anton lives in California’s Central Valley with his wife and two young children, where family, work, art, and inner exploration are not separate pursuits but parts of the same experiment of being alive and aware.
